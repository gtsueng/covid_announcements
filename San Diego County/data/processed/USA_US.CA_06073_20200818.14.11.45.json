The County met a state metric for fewer than 100 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people for a third consecutive day on Monday.\nThe case rate must remain under 100 for an additional 14 days, until Aug. 31, before K through 12 schools can reopen, if they choose to do so.\nFor now, all current restrictions on businesses or other activities, including those required to operate outdoors, remain in place. The restrictions will continue even after the 14-day period, unless the state provides additional guidance.\n\u201cGetting off the state\u2019s County Monitoring List is a great first step, but we need to keep it up for another two weeks before all schools can open for in-person learning,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.\nThe County was placed on the state\u2019s Monitoring List more than six weeks ago, on July 3. To continue the downward trend in County case numbers, Dr. Wooten urges San Diegans to continue to wear face coverings, keep six feet apart, avoid large gatherings, frequently wash your hands and stay home if you\u2019re sick.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200818.14.11.45", "about": [{"@type": "PoliciesAndGuidelines", "name": "county off state watchlist", "policyType": "metrics/criteria", "subject": "case rate <100/100000", "policyStatus": "performed"}]}
