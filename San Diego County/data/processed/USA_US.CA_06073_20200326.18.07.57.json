Should that occur, there might not be enough hospital beds or mechanical respirators for everyone who needs them.\nBut being at home, does not necessarily mean you should not go out entirely.\nYou can go out to:\n\nGet food and other essential needs. Plan so you make as few trips out as possible.\nCare for a family member, relative or friend\nGet medical attention\nPick up medications\nWalk your dog\nGo for a walk if you only do it with people living with you\nWork if you\u2019re an essential employee\n\nCounty COVID-19 Cases Reach 341\nCounty officials also revealed some new statistics on COVID-19. To date:\n\nMore than 4,000 San Diegans have been tested, resulting in 341 local cases, including 64 new cases reported today. The County\u2019s total no longer includes non-residents to avoid double counting in the state.\nMore than 543,000 personal protective equipment items have been distributed to the local medical community, including 423,805 N-95 respirators.\nMore than 2,000 hotel rooms have been secured to isolate people who have potential COVID-19 symptoms and people who are vulnerable and have no place to live.\n257 handwashing stations have been placed throughout the region and bathrooms are also being ordered.\nCounty Homeless Outreach Teams have distributed 1,785 hygiene kits among people who are homeless.\n\nThe County\u2019s COVID-19 webpage now contains a graph showing new positive cases and total cases reported by date.
