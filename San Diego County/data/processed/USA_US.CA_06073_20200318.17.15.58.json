You can go out to:\n\nGet food and other essential needs\nCare for a family member, relative or friend\nGet medical attention\nPick up medications\nIf you\u2019re an essential employee\n\n\u201cIf you need to be out, don\u2019t go out in groups,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cWe all must do everything we can to avoid getting COVID-19 and making others sick.\u201d\nAll the guidelines being issued will help flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent many people from getting sick at the same time.\nSocial distancing has been proven to slow the spread of pandemics so that sick people don\u2019t overwhelm healthcare systems. Should that occur, there might not be enough hospital beds or mechanical respirators for everyone who needs them.\n\u201cPeople should be six feet apart when conducting essential activities,\u201d Wooten said.\nLocal COVID-19 Cases\nTo date, a total of 60 cases have been reported in the region \u2014 51 in San Diego County residents, five from the federal quarantine and four in non-residents.\nForty-seven of the total cases are in people between the age of 18 and 64 years of age and 13 were 65 years of age or older.\nGet COVID-19 Info Via Text\nCounty residents can now receive information about the novel coronavirus via text thanks to the County COVID-19 public information text message alert system.\nThe system allows County health officials to send real-time information about COVID-19 in the region.
