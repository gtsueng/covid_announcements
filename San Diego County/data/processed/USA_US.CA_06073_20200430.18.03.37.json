Cities may have their own parks restrictions, and anyone should check the rules for the specific park before visiting.\nAmong the revisions:\n\nParks and their parking lots can reopen with 50% parking capacity.\nMembers of the same household can sit, picnic, or participate in sports and other activities at parks. Group activities and gatherings are not allowed.\nGolf courses can open but must have a physical distancing and safety plan in place and conduct temperature screenings for employees and golfers. Golf carts are not allowed. Anyone with a 100-degree temperature or higher must not be allowed on the premises.\n\nThe County is also allowing recreational boating in local lakes, bays and the ocean. If more than one person is in the boat, they need to be members of the same household.\nBeaches were allowed to open April 27, but each city will decide whether its beach can open. However, all beach parking lots must remain closed, and no sitting or lying down is allowed at any local beaches.\nThe revised health order also requires everyone to wear a face covering when in public and within six feet of people not in the same household, or anytime when entering a business. See more details and exceptions.\nSan Diegans must continue to maintain physical distancing. Handwashing and other preventive measures are still recommended.\n\u201cAs San Diego County residents, you have done a great job over the past six weeks,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., County public health officer, after explaining that the County is easing some of the restrictions because the region has met four of the five federal criteria and state recommendations for reopening.\n\u201cIf we see a trend going in the wrong direction because people are not following the recommended guidelines, we can dial back the Health Officer Order,\u201d Wooten said, adding that her order has been extended until further notice and to align with the state.\n4 New COVID-19 Deaths and 132 Cases Reported\nFour more COVID-19 deaths have been reported bringing the region\u2019s total to 124.
