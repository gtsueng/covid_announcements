They would also maximize local landfill space by keeping out an estimated 11 times more debris that can be recycled; and allow more demolished concrete and asphalt to be used for new construction.\nThe changes would apply to construction and grading in the County\u2019s unincorporated communities and take effect April 1 if approved in a \u201csecond read\u201d of the ordinance by the Board Feb. 12.\nThe County\u2019s existing ordinance applies to construction projects at least 40,000 square feet in size. The changed ordinance would apply to projects as large as 1,000 square feet. County public works officials estimate that the change would increase the amount of construction debris kept out of landfills from 4,000 tons a year to 44,000 tons a year.\nThe County\u2019s Department of Public Works plans to post more information about the ordinance changes on its website if the changes are approved again in the Feb. 12 second read.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200129.14.38.30", "about": [{"@type":"Other", "description":"Not Evaluated--Notice has no relation to COVID-19, not even an indirect or cursory relationship."}]}
