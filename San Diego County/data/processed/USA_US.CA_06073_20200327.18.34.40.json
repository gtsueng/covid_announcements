Doing so will give the local health care system time to increase its capacity to care for more sick people.\nSan Diego COVID-19 Cases Reach 417\nThrough March 27, a total of 417 COVID-19 cases have been reported in San Diego County, including 76 cases today.\nOf San Diego County\u2019s cases, 249 (60%) were men and 166 (40%) were women.
