He even helped with the recovery phase of San Diego County\u2019s Lilac Fire in 2017.\nToney fills the role left open by Holly Porter, who was hired as the deputy chief administrative officer for the County\u2019s Public Safety Group, replacing Ron Lane after his retirement.\nToney, who most recently worked as the Southern Regional Administrator for the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services, helped lead the state\u2019s disaster response for 11 counties that included San Diego. He said the overall mission of the agency to help with planning, response and recovery during disasters is what attracted him to this field, and he noted Cal OES has done \u201ca lot of good work over the years.\u201d\nCal OES Director Mark Ghilarducci said Toney was a dedicated leader who \u201cgreatly contributed to our success and efficiency during the many recent disasters.\u201d Ghilarducci said he looked forward to continuing to work with Toney in his new position at San Diego County to further \u201cenhance public safety in California.\u201d\nIn his role with Cal OES, Toney was at the table when it discussed cutting-edge technology in the field, and he has plans to expand these services to San Diego and upping its capability in a disaster.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with the County (of San Diego) and County OES for many years, and I\u2019ve always been extremely impressed with the office. They\u2019ve already thought three steps ahead of some of the other jurisdictions that I\u2019ve seen so I knew it was a strong office,\u201d Toney said.\u00a0 \u201cThe county level works for me. I\u2019d like to get more local because I think that\u2019s where you can make the most impact.\u201d\nWith the state, Toney has worked alongside and observed other counties during disasters and has made mental notes of lessons learned and best practices, all of which he\u2019ll apply to San Diego County.\nHe plans to help create a model for integrating the private sector and non-governmental organizations more in the response and recovery phase of disasters. Toney said the private sector has so many resources to bring to the table and sometimes they just don\u2019t know how to engage government and what role they can play.\nHe puts an emphasis on communicating with the public, and said it\u2019s important in a disaster to have a source of verified information. Toney hopes to look at enhancing the County\u2019s emergency website information, including adding new mapping technology.\nToney said the biggest takeaway from assisting with other disasters is that it takes all agencies and the whole community together to respond and recover. He plans to meet with partner agencies in his first few months to help establish solid recovery plans.\nTo learn more about the County Office of Emergency Services, visit ReadySanDiego.org.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200113.12.26.11", "about": [{"@type": "PersonnelChangeInfo", "personnelType": "Person", "changeType": "Join", "relevantCategory": "Emergency Response","personnelInfo":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jeff Toney","givenName":"Jeff","familyName":"Toney","affiliation":{"name":"San Diego County Office of Emergency Services"}}}]}
