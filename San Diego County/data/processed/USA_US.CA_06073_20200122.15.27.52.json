One was to recruit volunteers who would help people unable to evacuate without assistance. The other was to advertise to those people who need assistance evacuating to make them aware of the program.\nDigital media design teacher Joseph Brendan Walsh said the project \u201chad a high priority because it is a serious need for the county.\u201d\nStephanie Clay, English teacher and senior internship coordinator, said, \u201cOne of the reasons I think this particular project is so powerful is it was built from a community relationship and the program is about building community relationships.\u201d\nEmergency Services provided direction on the messages, and the students gave their creative input.\n\u201cI really enjoyed working on my product because that kind of professional straightforward, concise product is something I really want to hone and I\u2019m pretty proud of my product.\u201d said Carson Brumfield, 17, who worked on one of the videos selected.\nAnother student, Javier Martinez, 17, who worked on the infographic team, said he took the messaging personally.\n\u201cMy inspiration for the project was my grandparents. My grandpa needs a cane to walk and so I want to make sure he\u2019s prepared,\u201d said Martinez.\nClay said students were guided to research the message and audiences and work with the client directly as they would in any other internship.\nThe best part of the project was that it was truly student-driven as far as products, Walsh said. Students acted as independent producers while he acted in an executive producer role only to keep the production process on task.\nThe other students on the team are Angel Adrian, Mary Sutton, Chyna Angobung, Shaun Madott, Andres Perez, Iris Gomez and Ana Castaneda.\nBelow are the videos produced by the team.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200122.15.27.52", "about": [{"@type":"Other", "description":"Not Evaluated--Notice has no relation to COVID-19, not even an indirect or cursory relationship."}]}
