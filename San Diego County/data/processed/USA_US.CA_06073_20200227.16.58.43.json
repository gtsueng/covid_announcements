The lab is one of dozens across the nation certified by the CDC to test for the new coronavirus.\n\u201cThe number of specimens we\u2019ve been getting for testing is currently low, but we expect the need to increase,\u201d said Brett Austin, director of HHSA\u2019s Public Health Lab. \u201cWe are ready to increase capacity as required.\u201d\nPrior to getting the testing kit, the County Public Health Lab had to send specimens to CDC and results took several days to return. Now, those tested for potential cases of COVID-19 will know their results in 24 to 48 hours. Positive tests will still need to be confirmed by the CDC.\nCounty Microbiologist Jovan Shepherd prepares a specimen for testing for new coronavirus.\nCDC currently recommends testing patients with symptoms \u2014 fever, cough or difficulty breathing \u2014 after returning from China or other areas with community transmission of coronavirus disease or who have had known contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case.\nThe risk of COVID-19 is still very low, especially if you have not travelled to an area where the virus has been detected or had close contact with a patient who tested positive for this new coronavirus.\n\u201cWe want to assure the public that we are prepared and are conducting surveillance just like we do for any communicable disease,\u201d Wooten said.\nHow to Protect Yourself from Coronaviruses\nIt\u2019s important for the public to be prepared should a local COVID-19 outbreak occur. To limit the spread of infection, you should:\n\nWash your hands\u00a0often to help protect you from germs.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\nAvoid close contact\u00a0with people who are sick.\nIf you are sick, stay home and\u00a0keep your distance\u00a0from others to protect them from getting sick too.\nCover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.\nPractice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.\n\nFor more information about COVID-19, visit the CDC\u2019s website or HHSA\u2019s Epidemiology Unit.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200227.16.58.43", "about": [{"@type": "DiseaseNotice", "infectiousAgent": {"name": "SARS-CoV-2", "url": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C169076"}, "infectiousDisease": {"name": "COVID-19", "url": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100096"}, "noticeType": ["diseasePreventionInfo", "other"]}]}
