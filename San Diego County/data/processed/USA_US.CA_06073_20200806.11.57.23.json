Those who need to vote in person will also have that option.\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nNearly 75% of the county\u2019s registered voters are already signed up to permanently receive their ballot by mail so the Registrar\u2019s Office is well positioned to manage this increase.\nIf you need to vote in person, polling places will be open for four days, Oct. 31 through Election Day, Nov. 3. Be prepared. There will be fewer locations than in prior elections, so your location has most likely changed.\n\nWhat do you need to do? \nBe Vote Ready!\n\nCheck your registration information. Make sure your residence and, if different, your mailing address is up to date.\nHave you moved or changed your name? Whether you are new to San Diego County or just moved down the street you need to re-register to vote.\nAre you a first-time voter? Register to vote \u2013 it takes less than two minutes.\n\nIn response to the governor\u2019s executive orders, the Registrar of Voters office has launched a Vote Safer San Diego campaign to encourage voters to vote from home.\nBallots will start going out in the mail the week of Oct. 5, giving voters nearly a month to mark their ballot and return it before Election Day.\nYou can now track your mail ballot every step of the way by signing up for \u201cWhere\u2019s My Ballot?\u201d. Sign up now to receive automatic notifications at sdvote.com.\nWhat if you need to vote in person?\nThe Registrar\u2019s office encourages you to take advantage of early voting:\n\n8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday starting Oct. 5 at the Registrar\u2019s office.\n8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday, Oct. 31 through Monday, Nov. 2 at your assigned polling place or the Registrar\u2019s office.\n\nThe Registrar\u2019s Office and polling places will be open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day, Nov. 3.\nIf you decide to vote in person, be sure to bring your mail ballot with you and prepare for long lines.
