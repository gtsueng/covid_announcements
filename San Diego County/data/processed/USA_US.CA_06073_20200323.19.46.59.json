County Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten made the announcement during a news conference Monday.\nGatherings larger than 10 people have been seen at beaches in recent days. Wooten said if local cities and municipalities cannot enforce social gathering orders, the public health order will allow the shutdown of city parks and beaches.\nSocial distancing requires staying six feet away from others who are not in your immediate family to reduce the risk of transmission and slow the spread of the disease.\nCases Rise to 230\nThrough 5 p.m. Monday, the County total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased to 230, with one death of a San Diego County resident reported yesterday.\nOf the 230 cases 213 were San Diego County residents and 17 were non-residents.\nOf the 230 cases, three are between 10 and 19 years old, 156 were people between the ages of 20 and 49; 32 were between 50 and 59; and 38 were 60 or older. The County\u2019s daily coronavirus in San Diego\u00a0webpage\u00a0now also breaks down the number of\u00a0cases by city and unincorporated communities.\nTesting\nWhen it comes to testing, Wooten reminded residents that 80% of people who get COVID-19 will have mild to moderate symptoms. They can self-isolate and stay home.\u00a0They do not need to be tested. If symptoms become worse, you should call your doctor.\n\u201cThis action, staying at home if you have mild to moderate symptoms, helps to protect our health care workers and decreases their use of personal protective equipment,\u201d said Wooten.\nPublic Health Nurse Line \nThe County has set up a nurse triage line to help 2-1-1 callers who have coronavirus symptoms.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a medical provider, but you have some symptoms, we urge you to call 2-1-1 and ask for the nurses\u2019 line,\u201d said Supervisor Greg Cox. \u201cIt\u2019ll be safer for you and others than going to a crowded emergency room or urgent care center.\u201d\nThe Public Health Nurse Line is available seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. After hours, callers can leave a voice mail and a nurse will return the call within 24 hours.\nMental Health Precautions\nThe COVID-19 disease is prompting many residents to take physical precautions, but\u00a0 maintaining their mental health may be another matter.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear, a lot of uncertainty around what\u2019s happening right now with the COVID virus, we also have looming economic difficulties that we know is associated with increased rates of depression and substance use,\u201d said Behavioral Health Services Director Dr. Luke Bergman. \u201cSo it\u2019s extremely important that as people start to experience those feelings that they address them now.\u201d\nBergman says residents can get help if they need it. If you have a medical emergency, call 911. But if you\u2019re experiencing a mental health crisis, call the Access and Crisis Line at 888-724-7240.\nHe also outlined some ways to support your mental health:\n\nMaintain meal, exercise and bedtime routines.\nConnect with others safely using technology.\nStay informed but avoid too much news.\nShare your concerns with friends and family.\n\nMore information is available at the County\u2019s Behavioral Health Services website.\nWhat Everyone Can Do to Minimize Chances of Getting COVID-19\nPeople can help limit the spread of infection, by taking these steps:\n\nWash your hands\u00a0often to help protect you from germs.\nUse an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available.
