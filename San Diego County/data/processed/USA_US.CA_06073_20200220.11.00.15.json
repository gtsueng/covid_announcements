Those who are bilingual receive an additional $15 if they are assigned specifically to provide language assistance to voters. Poll workers must be registered voters in California or must be permanent residents in the United States and have transportation to their assigned polling location. They will also need access to the internet to complete an online training and attend a two-hour class.\nThe Registrar\u2019s office is required by federal law to provide bilingual speakers and voting materials to voters who speak Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese and Chinese. A survey by the University of California, Berkeley showed a need for speakers of Arabic and Korean at about 90 precincts, so the Registrar\u2019s office is also recruiting poll workers bilingual in those languages for the March 3 election. If you are bilingual in any one of the six specific languages, the Registrar asks for your help in the election.\nProspective poll workers can apply online at sdvote.com.
