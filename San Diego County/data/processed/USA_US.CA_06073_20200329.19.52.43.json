Of the known cases, 106 (20.4%) have required hospitalization, 47 (9.1%) had to be placed in intensive care and seven (1.3%) have died.\nDr. Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., the medical director of the County\u2019s Epidemiology and Immunization Branch, warned against drawing conclusions about the local outbreak based on day-to-day results.\n\u201cIt takes a trend of many days to know how the outbreak is going, so fewer cases today compared to the day before does not indicate much,\u201d said McDonald.\nHe reemphasized following health orders to stay at home and only go out for essential needs, like grocery shopping or taking the dog for a walk.\nSocial distancing has been proven to slow the spread of pandemics so that sick people don\u2019t overwhelm the local health care system. The goal is to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of COVID-19 \u2013 meaning to spread the number of new cases out over time \u2013 and lessen the number of people who contract the virus and need hospitalization. Doing so will give the local health care system time to increase its capacity to care for more sick people.\nFood Safety\nIf a worker at a restaurant or food market tests positive for COVID-19, the business is required by state law to notify the County Department of Environmental Health. County public health officials work with the business to identify contacts of the employee and has persons at risk self-quarantine. A public notification is issued only if there are specific actions members of the public need to take.\nEnvironmental Health is working closely with the food industry during this outbreak. The department has developed materials on food safety practices, good food handler hygiene, and disinfection guidance, using current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental Protection Agency, and provided them to local restaurants and stores. In addition, this information for restaurant, food and beverage providers is posted online and has been translated into seven languages \u2013 English, Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Farsi and Arabic.\n\u201cSince early March, the County\u2019s Department of Environmental Health has been proactive and has worked with food facilities to educate them and help them adhere to the public health orders, such as modifying operations to take out or curbside pick-up,\u201d said Supervisor Nathan Fletcher.\nFood facilities should contact the Department of Environmental Heath\u2019s Epidemiology Liaison as soon as possible if they have a situation of an ill food handler (858) 505-6814 or fhdepi@sdcounty.ca.gov.\nAdditional Resources\nThe County\u2019s COVID-19 webpage contains a\u00a0graph showing new positive cases and total cases reported by date.\u00a0For more information, visit\u00a0www.coronavirus-sd.com.\nLive Well San Diego has launched\u00a0Live Well at Home, a collection of free resources aimed at helping San Diegans in maintaining a healthy mind and body while staying indoors.
