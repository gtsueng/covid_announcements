Increased onsite renewable energy generation. In 2018, County facilities produced enough electric power to run 515 homes for a year\nParks and recreation facilities have renewable energy systems and electric vehicle charging stations\nIn 2018, the Ramona library received a Gold LEED certification, and 20 more other LEED certs\n\nSolid Waste/Agriculture and Water\n\nRecycling, reducing and composting has removed 60% of solid waste from landfills\nThe County is committed to diverting more organic and construction debris from landfills to extend landfill life, reduce transportation costs, avoid methane emissions and improve air quality.\nPlanning & Development Services has conducted 220 school presentations on recycling and composting, and 6,442 recycling bins supplied to 224 schools, commercial and multi-family facilities\nCollecting organic material will improve soil and make working lands more resilient to drought and wildfires\nCounty actions are reducing water use at its own facilities through water-saving designs and through outdoor landscaping requirements for new private development\nOrganic waste processed into compost can be applied to local farms and gardens to improve soil health, conserve water and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers.\nThe County has worked with schools to plant 2,000 trees such as native oak, sycamore, cottonwood and willow. This will help reduce carbon dioxide in our environment.\nRain barrels: They capture water, but also reduce electric use involved in extracting, transporting and treating water.\nCounty actions are reducing water use at its own facilities through water-saving designs and through outdoor landscaping requirements for new private development\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200422.11.19.11", "about": [{"@type": "EventInfo", "name": "Earth Day Celebration Goes Virtual", "eventAccess": "public", "eventType": "festival", "hasVirtualReplacement": "full", "location": "limited access under physical distancing"}, {"@type": "PoliciesAndGuidelines", "policyType": "public guidelines", "subject": "physical distance", "policyStatus": "unclear"}, {"@type": "PhysicalAccessInfo", "name": "beaches, parks and trails access", "changeType": "open", "locationAccessType": "public", "locationType": "open space park", "hasVirtualReplacement": "none", "physicalAccessChangeType": "additional measures in place"}]}
