They will be placed at all 33 County library branches and in its two bookmobiles.\nThe 2020 census is the first that the U.S. Census Bureau is encouraging most people to answer online, although people will still be able to answer them by telephone or mail.\nCox said it\u2019s extremely important for people to take part in the census, which is conducted every 10 years, because the federal government uses census data to distribute federal funds to local communities.\n\u201cBecause of that,\u201d Cox said, \u201cwe are all here to urge everyone to participate in the census so that San Diego gets its share of federal funding to address issues like public transportation, services for children and funding to address homelessness.\u201d\nCounty Board Chairman Greg Cox and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra unveil new online census kiosks to be placed at all County libraries.\nCox said the County has also placed census promotion banners in the County lobbies; is delivering census information to homebound seniors who have meals delivered by providers working with the County\u2019s Aging and Independence program; has launched a census information webpage; and included census advertisements in the 1.8 million sample ballots the County sent to voters leading to the recent primary election.\nFor more information about the County Library, its branches, locations and operating hours, go to the Library webpage.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200312.16.45.48", "about": [{"@type": "EventInfo", "name": "The 2020 census", "eventAccess": "public", "eventType": "community survey", "hasVirtualReplacement": "full"}]}
