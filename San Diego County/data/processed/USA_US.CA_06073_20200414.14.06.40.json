If your property or small business sustained damage from the rain, the County would like your help to estimate rain damages in our region.\nThe County Office of Emergency Services is asking storm-affected residents to complete a short\u00a0damage survey\u00a0form that will assist the County in collecting damage information and associated costs from the rains.\nThe information gathered from the surveys will be used to estimate total damages countywide and determine if enough damage occurred to qualify the region for disaster assistance, such as low interest disaster loans from the Small Business Administration for those who are uninsured or underinsured.\nCompleting the form does not guarantee\u00a0the region or the property owner will be eligible to receive disaster assistance. For additional information, visit\u00a0sdcountyrecovery.com\u00a0or email\u00a0oes@sdcounty.ca.gov.\nIf your property was damaged by the storm and you need immediate assistance, other local services may be available through www.211sandiego.org.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200414.14.06.40", "about": [{"@type": "EventInfo", "name": "Storm damage assessment survey", "eventAccess": "public", "eventType": "community survey", "hasVirtualReplacement": "full"}]}
