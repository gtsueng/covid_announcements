Six have been placed in Carlsbad and 14 in unincorporated areas of the county, primarily Lakeside, Spring Valley, Ramona and Fallbrook.\n\u201cNext to sequestering those who are ill, frequent and proper handwashing is one of the best ways to prevent COVID-19,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re placing stations across the region so that people who are homeless can have a place to wash their hands with soap and water.\u201d\nIn addition to the handwashing stations, the County is preparing to send Homeless Outreach Teams into the streets to educate people who are homeless on how to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus and distribute supply kits that contain helpful information.\nThe County is increasing the public health nurse presence at the City of San Diego\u2019s bridge shelters in order to screen people for symptoms of respiratory illness. It also will assess on an ongoing basis the need for support at other shelter locations. In addition, the county is preparing to enhance its ability to house people who might need to be quarantined.\nHHSA health information specialists have been trained on how to provide COVID-19 presentations in the community for businesses, community and faith-based organizations.\nOn March 3, Wooten sent letters to all city managers informing them she was installing additional handwashing stations to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 locally.\nThe County is ready to procure, pay for and place temporary handwashing stations in areas that would benefit the most from this preventive measure.\nSymptoms of COVID-19\nPatients with confirmed COVID-19 infection have reported symptoms ranging from mild to severe respiratory illness. Symptoms generally include:\n\nfever\ncough\nshortness of breath/difficulty breathing\n\nAt this time, the CDC believes that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days, or as long as 14 days, after exposure.\nThrough March 9, HHSA had placed 76 patients under investigation. Fifty-six have tested negative and 20 are pending. A total of 464 people have been placed under self-quarantine at home; 376 have finished their quarantine and 82 are currently being monitored. Six people ended up developing symptoms and became patients under investigation.\n\u201cWe are monitoring these people daily and taking appropriate actions when they develop symptoms,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that if you did not have close contact to the patient with COVID-19, the risk of infection is still low.\u201d\nWhat Residents Can Do to Prepare for COVID-19\nIt\u2019s important for the public to be prepared should a COVID-19 outbreak occur in San Diego County. To limit the spread of infection, you should:\n\nWash your hands\u00a0often to help protect you from germs.\nUse an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. It should contain at least 60% alcohol.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\nAvoid close contact\u00a0with people who are sick.\nIf you are sick, stay home and\u00a0keep your distance\u00a0from others to protect them from getting sick too.\nCover your mouth and nose\u00a0with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.\nPractice other good health habits.
