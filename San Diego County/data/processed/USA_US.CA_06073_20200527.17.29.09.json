The hospital also will test its entire staff.\nThe goal is to start with about 400 tests daily and ramp up over the next six weeks to about 2,000 tests a day. The tests will be free to all participants. Children are automatically covered under state law. Costs for adults without insurance will be paid by the County.\n\u201cCOVID-19 is not a disease that only impacts older adults,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cPediatric cases have been reported in San Diego County.\u201d\nOf the nearly 7,000 COVID-19 cases in the region, 5.6% or 391 cases have been reported in children and teenagers. Also, about 52% of the cases were in people between 20 and 49 years of age.\nWooten added that it is important to offer testing to families because there have been reports of children who had COVID-19 but lacked symptoms, leaving them in a position where they could unknowingly spread the virus.\nMore Testing in Rural Communities\nCAL FIRE and the San Diego County Fire Authority announced six more dates when testing will be offered in rural communities.\nDrive-up testing sites will be available from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. in five communities.
