Making sure students have all the required vaccines is part of the countywide\u00a0Live Well San Diego\u00a0vision, an effort to improve the health and well-being of residents in the region.\nThe CDC recommends adolescent children get immunized against the following diseases:\n\nHPV\nBoys and girls need all shots in the series for full protection. HPV vaccine for girls and young women prevents cervical cancer. The vaccine is also recommended for boys to prevent anal cancer and genital warts.\nMeningococcal disease\nMeningococcal bacteria are known to cause serious illnesses in children and adolescents. The bacteria can infect the blood and cause inflammation of the tissues covering the brain and the spinal cord. Ten percent of teens who become ill die, and another 15 percent suffer long-term disability such as loss of limbs, deafness, nervous system problems or brain damage.\nTetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (grouped in one vaccine called Tdap)\nAll students entering 7thgrade need proof of a Tdap booster in order to attend school.\nInfluenza\nThe flu vaccine is recommended every year for everyone 6 months and older. Like most of the nation, San Diego County is currently going through a severe influenza season.\nChickenpox\nChickenpox, or varicella, is a viral infection that causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. While chickenpox is a mild disease for most people, it can be life-threatening for some. Two doses are recommended.\n\nThe above vaccines are available at physician offices, community clinics, and many retail pharmacies. People without medical insurance can get vaccinated at one of the seven\u00a0County locations;\u00a0call 2-1-1 for a location nearest you.\nFor more information on vaccines, call the HHSA Immunization Branch at (866) 358-2966 or visit\u00a0www.sdiz.org.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200228.14.56.39", "about": [{"@type": "DiseaseNotice", "infectiousAgent": [{"name": "Human Papilloma Virus", "url": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_10566"},
