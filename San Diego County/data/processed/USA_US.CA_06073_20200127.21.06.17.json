Many of the patients in the pneumonia outbreak caused by 2019-nCov in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV have not reported exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring.\nPotential Case Reported\nLast week, HHSA issued a health alert to the local medical community asking them to be on the lookout for and report potential cases in people who have traveled to the areas where cases of this new virus (2019-nCoV) have been reported.\nOn Sunday, a potential case was reported to HHSA in a person who travelled to 2019-nCoV impacted areas in China. After consulting with a local hospital, a specimen was collected, sent to the County Public Health Lab for packaging and then sent to the CDC for testing.\nThe patient is currently in isolation at home and results are expected back from the CDC tomorrow. Currently, the CDC is the only entity capable of testing for this novel coronavirus.\nIn the meantime, the County has been conducting its investigation to identify people who may have had close contact with the patient and quarantine them.\n\u201cThe risk of infection for the general public is minimal,\u201d Wooten added. \u201cIf you have not traveled to an area where the virus has been detected or had close contact with a patient who tested positive for this type of coronavirus, the risk of infection is very low.\u201d\nWhat to Do if You\u2019ve Traveled to an Impacted Area?\nCurrently, five airports across the nation are monitoring returning travelers from areas impacted with this new strain of coronavirus.\nPatients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection have reported mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of:\n\nfever\ncough\nshortness of breath/difficulty breathing\n\nAt this time, the CDC believes that symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure.\nIf you\u2019ve travelled to one of the impacted areas and start to develop symptoms, you should contact your medical provider before showing up at their office so that they can take the necessary precautions before your visit.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve travelled to an impacted area and start showing symptoms, call your doctor so that they can take the required steps to avoid infecting others,\u201d Wooten said.\nWooten added that people should abstain from travelling to impacted areas unless \u201cit\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u201d\nHow to Protect Yourself from Coronaviruses\nPractice everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\nStay home when you are sick.\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\n\u201cThese everyday habits can help prevent the spread of several viruses,\u201d Wooten said.\nFor more information about 2019-nCoV, visit the CDC\u2019s website or HHSA\u2019s Epidemiology Unit.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200127.21.06.17", "about": [{"@type": "DiseaseNotice", "infectiousAgent": {"name": "SARS-CoV-2", "url": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C169076", "identifier": "NCIT_C169076"}, "infectiousDisease": {"name": "COVID-19", "url": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100096", "identifier": "MONDO_0100096"}, "noticeType": "diseasePreventionInfo"}]}
