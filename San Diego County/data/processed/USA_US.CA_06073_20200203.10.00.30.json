Early voting began Monday and will continue from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and until the polls close on Election Day. The office will also be open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 29 and Sunday, March 1 for weekend voting.\nOver 1.3 million mail ballots were sent out through the U.S. Postal Service Monday, and voters could find them in their mailboxes as early as that same day.\n\u201cIf you know how you want to vote, grab that mail ballot when you get it, mark it and send it back in right away,\u201d said Registrar Michael Vu. \u201cThe sooner we get the ballot back, the sooner we can start processing it so it will be counted right when the polls close at 8 p.m. on March 3.\u201d\nYou\u2019ll also find something new in your mail ballot packet this year\u2013 an \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker.\nMail ballots are convenient for voters who\u2019d rather not make a special trip to the Registrar of Voter\u2019s office to cast their ballots or wait for the polls to open on Election Day. Registered voters can request a mail ballot until Feb. 25.\nMeantime, the Registrar is still looking for poll workers, especially bilingual poll workers.
