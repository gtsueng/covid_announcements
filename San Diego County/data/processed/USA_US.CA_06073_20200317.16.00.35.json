To sign up to receive the messages, text COSD COVID19 to 468-311.\nThe system was set up to let County public health officials issue information and instructions on changes related to COVID-19 in the region.\nFlattening the Curve\nCounty health officials are requiring residents not working and students out of school to stay at home to avoid contracting COVID-19. They should only be out to get food or other essential needs, such as caring for a relative, getting medical attention, picking up prescriptions or to go to work.\n\u201cWe all have a role to play to keep the virus from spreading in our communities,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cPeople should not be out and about, unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary and people are not in a group.\u201d\nWooten issued the new guidance March 16 to try to flatten the curve of the pandemic and prevent many people from getting sick at the same time.\nThe goal is to practice social distancing to slow the spread of the pandemic so that sick people don\u2019t overwhelm the healthcare system. Should that occur, there might not be enough hospital beds or mechanical respirators for everyone who needs them.\n\u201cPeople should be six feet apart when out on the street conducting essential activities,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cSocial distancing is an effective tool to slow the spread of pandemics.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re live at the County Operations Center with another update on the coronavirus.
