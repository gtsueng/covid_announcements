For example, this year\u2019s number two crop, Bedding Plants, Color & Herbaceous Perennials, like flowers and herbs, was combined with Cactuses & Succulents and had a total value of $399,028,516.\nThe third-ranked crop, Indoor Flowering & Foliage Plants earned a total value of $291,335,199. The fourth-ranked, and possibly San Diego\u2019s most famous crop, Avocados, increased in value by nearly 16% and $19 million, from $121,038,020 in 2018 to $140,116,363.\nThe\u00a0annual Crop Report\u00a0is compiled by the County\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures and can be seen\u00a0online. The report provides a yearly snapshot of an industry that remains a staple of the region\u2019s economy despite challenges like drought, rising water costs, fires, freezes and pests.\nSan Diego County\u2019s Board of Supervisors has taken several actions in recent years to boost agriculture, including: creating a boutique winery ordinance to promote the creation of small wineries; approving a new beekeeping ordinance that allows more beekeeping while protecting the public; adopting an agricultural easement program that preserves agricultural space; streamlining regulations for things like cheese-making, agritourism and onsite horticultural sales.\nSupervisor Jim Desmond\u2019s Fifth District, home to a lot of the county\u2019s agricultural land, said agriculture is an important part of the economy.\n\u201cOver the last year, we have seen how essential farming is in San Diego County,\u201d Desmond said. \u201cIt is an honor to be the supervisor of District Five, which has a diverse variety of agricultural crops ranging from flowers to strawberries and avocados. I will continue to be a supporter of agriculture, which will always be essential to the region\u2019s economy!\u201d\nOther interesting highlights from the 2019 Crop Report include:\n\nThe agriculture industry continues to do more with less, increasing in total value while working fewer acres. In 2019 total agriculture values increased 1.5% while reporting 234,477 acres in production. That was 3.3% fewer acres reported in 2018 and the fewest number of acres reported in production in 17 years \u2014 since 2002.\nThe increase to $140.1 million for Avocados, was that crop\u2019s largest value since 2014.\nOne of the largest percentage increases was for \u201cField, other,\u201d which included a relatively new crop, industrial hemp. The category increased a whopping 373% from $794,625 in 2018 to $3,760,517.\nWine Grapes saw its third year of double-digit percent increases, rising 21.5% from $4,591,032 in 2018 to $5,580,300. Wine Grapes became a trendy crop and soared by over 500% in 2012, two years after the Board of Supervisors approved the Boutique Winery Ordinance to promote the creation of small wineries.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the 2019 Crop Report\u2019s Top 10 Crops:\n\nFor more information, go to the 2019 Crop Report.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200825.15.07.59", "about": [{"@type": "Other", "description": "Not Evaluated--Notice has no relation to COVID-19, not even an indirect or cursory relationship."}]}
