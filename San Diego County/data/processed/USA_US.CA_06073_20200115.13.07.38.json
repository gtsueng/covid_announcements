If people stir that dry matter into the air by sweeping or vacuuming, they can inhale the virus and get sick.\nHantavirus is common in San Diego County. In 2019, 42 rodents collected in routine trapping tested positive for hantavirus. There is no cure or vaccine for hantavirus and it can cause deadly infections in people.\nHowever, people are unlikely to be exposed to the virus because its main carriers \u2014 wild rodents and particularly wild mice \u2014 prefer to live away from people.\nStill, County officials said people should be careful to use wet cleaning methods if they find rodent droppings or evidence that wild rodents have gotten into homes, garages, sheds, cabins and other living spaces, and must clean.\nHere are tips for people to prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, and instructions for how to use wet-cleaning methods.\nAvoid Exposure to Hantavirus\n\nSeal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.\nEliminate rodent infestations immediately.\nAvoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.\nClean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.\n\nUse \u201cWet-cleaning\u201d Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus\n\nDo not sweep or vacuum infested areas.\nVentilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.\nUse rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent droppings, nests, contaminated traps, and surrounding areas and let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.\nClean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.\nPlace disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard in the trash.\nWash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.\nThoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.\n\nFor more information, contact the County Department of Environmental Health (DEH) at (858) 694-2888\u00a0or visit the\u00a0DEH hantavirus web page.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200115.13.07.38", "about": [{"@type": "DiseaseNotice", "infectiousAgent": {"name": "Hantavirus", "url": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C14213", "identifier": "NCIT_C14213"}, "infectiousDisease": {"name": "hantavirus infectious disease", "url": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0005780", "identifier": "MONDO_0005780"}, "noticeType": ["testResult", "diseasePreventionInfo"]}]}
