Gavin Newsom is expected to announce modifications to his order later this week and allow more businesses to safely open.\nBut before businesses can reopen, they need to create a Safe Reopening Plan, which ensures the safety of employees and customers. A template is available now that businesses will need to complete, print and post the plan at their entrance. The plan, which also ensures proper sanitation, physical distancing and general business practices, may need to be updated, and displayed again, depending on direction from the state.\nThe governor announced that retail and manufacturing businesses with curbside pick-up will be allowed to reopen because they represent a lower risk of spreading COVID-19. Among them:\n\nBookstores\nClothing stores\nToy stores\nFlorists\nSporting goods\n\nThe County recognizes that business owners and the public are anxious for more businesses to reopen, but their reopening is aligned with the easing of the governor\u2019s order and must be done safely.\nWhen they open their doors, businesses must ensure that social distancing and the face covering guidelines are being followed to prevent or slow the spread of the virus.\nCounty health officials believe San Diegans will continue to do the right thing.\n\u201cWe have confidence in our residents and businesses,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cEveryone has done a great job and that is why numbers are trending in the right direction.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Testing \nCOVID-19 testing is more widely available in the region. It is available at local hospitals, medical groups, some community clinics and private labs.\nThe state has also opened three testing sites \u2013 in Escondido, El Cajon and Chula Vista \u2013 that are offering free testing by appointment. If you have no Internet access, call\u00a0888-634-1123, Monday through\u00a0Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. to get tested.\nWhile appointments at the state sites have been filled for this week, San Diegans are encouraged to regularly visit the site to register for a spot for next week.\nThe new Live Well Mobile Office, as well as the County Library\u2019s bookmobiles and other County vehicles will be deployed for testing throughout the region. A doctor\u2019s referral is requested for appointments through 2-1-1 testing at County sites, although nurses handling the calls can connect individuals without a doctor to a medical provider.\nCOVID-19 Testing, Cases and Deaths\nTesting:\n\n2,260 tests were reported to the County May 5 and 159 or 7% were positive.\n6.2% was yesterday\u2019s 14-day, rolling average percentage of positive tests.\n\n\u00a0Cases:\n\n159 new cases were reported for a San Diego County total of 4,319.\n882 or 20.4% of cases have required hospitalization.\n281 or 6.5% of all cases had to be placed in intensive care.\n\nDeaths:\n\nEight more COVID-19 deaths have been reported, bringing the region\u2019s total to 158.\nThe new deaths were five men and three women between the ages of 45 and 87.
