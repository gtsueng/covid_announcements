The woman was hospitalized and remains at a local hospital in isolation with serious symptoms.\nHer test results came back positive late this afternoon at the County Public Health Laboratory, which is sending specimens to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for final confirmation.\nHHSA is aggressively working to find out where she had been prior to being hospitalized and how many people had close contact with her. The appropriate people will be placed under self-quarantine and monitored for possible symptoms of COVID-19.\n\u201cWe knew we would see cases in San Diego County and were prepared for them,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThe public should be assured that we are following CDC guidance and continue taking appropriate steps to keep the novel coronavirus from spreading.\u201d\nSymptoms of COVID-19\nPatients with confirmed COVID-19 infection have reported symptoms ranging from mild to severe respiratory illness. Symptoms generally include:\n\nfever\ncough\nshortness of breath/difficulty breathing\n\nAt this time, the CDC believes that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days, or as long as 14 days, after exposure.\nThrough March 9, HHSA had placed 76 patients under investigation. Fifty-six have tested negative and 19 are pending. A total 464 people have been placed under self-quarantine at home, 376 have finished their quarantine and 82 are currently being monitored. Six people ended up developing symptoms and became patients under investigation.\n\u201cWe are monitoring these people daily and taking appropriate actions when they develop symptoms,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that if you did not have close contact\nto the patient with COVID-19 or someone who\u2019s traveled to an impacted country or region, the risk of infection is still low.\u201d\nWhat Residents Can Do to Prepare for COVID-19\nIt\u2019s important for the public to be prepared should a COVID-19 outbreak occur in San Diego County.
