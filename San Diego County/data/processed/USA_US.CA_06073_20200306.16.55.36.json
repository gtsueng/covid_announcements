Some stations may have a limited supply.\nSand and Bags\n\nBonita/Sunnyside: 4900 Bonita Road, Bonita, CA 91902\u00a0P: 619-479-2346\nBoulevard: 40080 Ribbonwood Road, Boulevard, CA 91905 P: 619-390-2020\nDe Luz:\u00a039431 De Luz Road, Fallbrook, CA 92028 P: 760-728-2422\nDulzura: 17304 Highway 94, Dulzura, CA 91917 P: 619-468-3391\nFallbrook: 4375 Pala Mesa Drive, Fallbrook, CA 92028 P: 760-723-2024\nJulian: 3407 Highway 79, Julian, CA 92036 P:760-765-1510\nLakeside River Park\u00a0Conservancy:12108 Industry Road, Lakeside CA 92040 P: 619-443-4770\u00a0*(Closed over the weekend; open Monday-Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.)\nPalomar Mountain: 21610 Crestline Road, Palomar Mtn., CA 92060 P: 760-742-3701\nRamona: 3410 Dye Road, Ramona, CA 92065 P: 760-789-0107\nRamona: 24462 San Vicente Road, Ramona, CA 92065 P: 760-789-9465\nRincon: 16971 Highway 76, Pauma Valley, CA 92061 P: 760-742-3243\nValley Center: 28205 N.
