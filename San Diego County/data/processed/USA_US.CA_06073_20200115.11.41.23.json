All had underlying medical conditions, except a 57-year-old San Diego woman who died Jan. 3.\nAlso, there was a significant spike in lab-confirmed influenza cases last week when a total of 2,095 cases were reported. In comparison, 510 flu cases were reported during the same week last season and 2,152 during the 2017-18 season.\n\u201cInfluenza deaths are very unfortunate, but they occur every season,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H.,\u00a0County public health officer. \u201cIt is never too late to get vaccinated, since increased flu activity could last through May, and influenza viruses cause illness in San Diego year-round.\u201d\nWhen to Seek Medical Help\nInfluenza-like illnesses at local emergency departments dropped to 8% week, compared to 9% the prior week.\nPeople with influenza-like symptoms continue to crowd local emergency departments and are taxing some hospitals.\nCounty health officials are encouraging people who are sick to first contact their health care provider by telephone or arrange an urgent appointment. \u00a0You should go to an emergency department when you have any of the following symptoms:\n\nDifficulty breathing or shortness of breath\nChest pain or abdominal pain\nSudden dizziness\nConfusion\nSevere or persistent vomiting\nFlu-like symptoms that appear to get better, but then return with a fever and worse cough\n\nThe County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.\nFor the week ending Jan. 11, 2020, the report shows the following:\n\nEmergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 8% of all visits (compared to 9% the previous week)\nTotal influenza deaths to date: 20 (compared to 16 at this time last season)\nTotal lab-confirmed cases to date: 7,557 (compared to 2,643 last season)\n\nHow to Prevent the Flu\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.\nFlu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:\n\nPeople with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control\nPregnant women\nPeople aged 65 years and older\nPeople who live with or care for others who are at higher risk\n\nIn addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:\n\nWash hands thoroughly and often\nUse hand sanitizers\nStay away from sick people\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth\nClean commonly touched surfaces\nIf you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others\n\nThe flu vaccine is available at doctors\u2019 offices and retail pharmacies.
