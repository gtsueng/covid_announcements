People with symptoms without a provider or health care coverage can call 2-1-1 and ask to speak to the nurse triage line to request a referral. The nurses can give a referral and make an appointment to get tested.\nPeople without an appointment will not be tested.\nHours of operation at the two sites are as follows:\n10 a.m. \u2013 3 p.m.\nMonday to Friday\nNorth Inland Live Well Escondido Center\n649 W. Mission Ave., Escondido, CA 92025\n1 \u2013 7 p.m.\nMonday to Friday\nLive Well Center at Chula Vista\n690 Oxford Street, Chula Vista, CA 91911\nTesting capacity will also continue at the County\u2019s first drive-up site at the San Diego County Credit Union Stadium in Mission Valley.\nMobile testing sites will soon be deployed in other parts of the region to accommodate the growing demand for testing.\nThe nasal swab tests at all three sites are conducted by County Public Health nurses and using the County Public Health lab. Results typically take between 24-48 hours.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200427.10.25.31", "about": [{"@type": "TestingInfo", "testType": "unspecified", "otherCriteria": ["doctor referral", "appointment"]}, {"@type": "PhysicalAccessInfo", "name": "New testing sites", "changeType": "open", "locationAccessType": "specific", "locationType": "testing sites", "hasVirtualReplacement": "unclear", "physicalAccessChangeType": "additional measures in place", "location": ["Escondido", "Chula Vista"]}]}
