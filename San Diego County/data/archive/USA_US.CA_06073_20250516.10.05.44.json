There have been no reported human cases in San Diego County this year.\nHowever, West Nile virus remains a potentially deadly threat. And County officials said people should continue to follow the County\u2019s \u201cPrevent, Protect, Report\u201d guidelines to protect themselves from mosquitoes. Those include finding and dumping out standing water around homes to keep mosquitoes from breeding.\nWest Nile virus is mainly a bird disease, but it can be transmitted to humans by several types of mosquitoes if they feed on an infected bird and then bite people.\nSome people who become infected can suffer symptoms including headache, fever, nausea, fatigue, skin rash, or swollen glands. But in rare cases, West Nile virus can make people extremely ill and even kill them.\nProtecting against mosquitoes is always important in San Diego County.\nCounty officials said people can help protect themselves from mosquito-borne illnesses by following the County\u2019s \u201cPrevent, Protect, Report\u201d guidelines.\nPrevent mosquito breeding\nDump out or remove any item inside or outside of homes that can hold water\u2014whether from rain or landscape irrigation. Those things can include plant saucers, rain barrels, buckets, garbage cans, toys, old tires and wheelbarrows. Mosquito fish, available for free by contacting the Vector Control Program, may be used to control mosquito breeding in backyard water sources such as stagnant swimming pools, ponds, fountains and horse troughs.\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites\nProtect yourself from mosquito-borne illnesses by wearing long sleeves and pants or use insect repellent when outdoors. Use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone or IR3535.
