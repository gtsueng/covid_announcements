The training is funded by a grant from LISTOS California. ASL interpreters will be at the event.\nThe four-hour presentation highlights preparedness for pets and people, mitigation such as wildfire prevention and home hardening, evacuation planning, the new Genasys Evac map, what local assistance centers are, and an outline of the recovery process. All attendees will receive a personal disaster plan book to start their own emergency plan.\nThe course helps people through various prevention and preparation steps to\u00a0 prepare people for \u00a0what might happen and how they can help themselves and their families or neighbors.\nFor those who want to learn more disaster skills, the Community Emergency Response Team is a group of trained community members who learn from emergency responders how to manage some emergency situations such as small fires, search and rescue and providing medical aid until emergency responders can arrive and take over.\nTo register, call or text Teresa Greenhalgh at (619) 857-8050 or email at Teresa.Greenhalgh@sdcounty.ca.gov.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250415.17.17.45"}
