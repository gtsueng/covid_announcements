Make sure your vehicle is well maintained as faulty catalytic converters have been a major cause of accidental fires in San Diego County.\n\n\nIf you have a trailer on your vehicle, make sure the chains don\u2019t drag on the ground while driving and spark a fire.\n\nBe Emergency Ready\nCounty public health and animal officials offer various tips to keep yourself, your friends and family and pets safe from heat illnesses.\nAn important factor in being prepared is to stay informed in the event of a regional emergency.\n\nResidents can download the County\u2019s\u00a0SD Emergency app in English\u00a0or\u00a0Spanish from the Google Play or Apple App stores. The app provides news updates, maps, shelter locations and includes disaster planning templates and interactive checklists. If a regional emergency, such as a wildfire, does occur, updates and other information will be posted at\u00a0sdcountyemergency.com\u00a0\u00a0and sent out via the app.\nRegister for\u00a0AlertSanDiego\u00a0\u00a0or at\u00a0ListoSanDiego, the County\u2019s cell phone notification service. By doing that, you will receive any emergency messages such as evacuation warnings that apply to your neighborhood on your cell phone.\nDon\u2019t wait until an emergency, when you\u2019re already stressed to figure out what you need to do in the event of an evacuation. Complete a family disaster plan template from the app or from\u00a0ReadySanDiego.org\u00a0to help your family plan for an emergency including where to meet if you are separated and cannot return home.\nYou can also stay in touch with official emergency information by following\u00a0CAL FIRE/San Diego County Fire on Twitter\u00a0in the event of a fire.
