The morning has been an amazing surprise to Franklin.\n\u201cMy dad took me to my school and then I saw cops and then they said my name. And I told them, \u2018I\u2019m not going to jail,\u2019 and they said no they were going to take me to go to SeaWorld and to go get whatever I want for $200,\u201d he recounted breathlessly.\nFranklin happily shows off his blue Switch Lite and game to play on it. The game was an early present from Bernal because the cost of the device used up the gift card.\nCounty Probation, the Sheriff\u2019s Department and the District Attorney\u2019s Bureau of Investigation\u00a0 joined other local law enforcement agencies, SeaWorld, Target and STAR/PAL to sponsor the 28th annual event, providing 300 local children with a happier holiday season and encouraging positive relationships with officers.\nThe fun morning started at SeaWorld where the children were paired with an officer or deputy. The children and law enforcement were treated to private sea animal shows and breakfast at the theme park. Later, the children and their partner rode in patrol vehicles with lights flashing and sirens blaring for a $200 shopping spree.\nHundreds of the patrol vehicles caravanned to the Sports Arena Target. Children\u2019s voices\u00a0booming out on speakers wishing people a Merry Christmas.\nFor Uriah, \u00a0it will be a 9th birthday to remember. As he walked into Target with his partner Deputy Ryan Martinez, he was serenaded by a volunteer when told it was the boy\u2019s birthday. And by two rows of greeters dressed as Star Wars characters and Target staff volunteers clapping them into the store. Actually, the greeters are for every child who went in to make them all feel special.\nInside, Uriah bought gifts for all of his family. And something fun for himself.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for LOL dolls, that one,\u201d said Savannah, 8, who was paired with Probation Officer Janet Moore. From there she went on to discuss all the cute accessories that come with the doll.\nThe Escondido Police were the host agency this year and over 300 uniformed officers from more than 30 different local, state, and federal agencies volunteered to partner with a deserving child, selected from local schools.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the highlights of our year \u2014 for me it is,\u201d said Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Ruben Gonzales, who is participating for the fifth time. \u201cThis is such a great event, to give back to the community and kids. They love it. We get as much joy out of this, probably more, than they do. He didn\u2019t even know that he was coming today. Mom surprised him. She told him last night, you have to get up early and didn\u2019t tell him why.\u201d\nLaw enforcement agencies raise money for the event by holding sporting events, breakfasts and other fundraising events throughout the year.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20221203.17.04.03"}
