Bol Awards for Outstanding Achievement.\nThe award announcement came during the celebration of Little Free Library Week, which ran from May 14-20.\nLittle libraries are mailbox-like structures put up in communities to create neighborhood book exchanges where people can freely borrow or leave books for others to read. They can be found all around San Diego County.\nIn 2021, the Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to create a \u201clittle libraries\u201d initiative to boost literacy in low-income and communities of color by giving the people and children living in them more opportunities to have books to read in their homes. San Diego County Library (SDCL) currently has 45 Little Free Libraries installed across the region and 56 more on their way.\nSDCL is working in partnership with the San Diego Council on Literacy, other public library jurisdictions in the region, collective Friends of the Library groups, and local non-profits and volunteer groups to implement Little Free Libraries throughout the county.\nSDCL Little Free Libraries are now open at the following locations:\u00a0(view map)\nSweetwater Community Garden\n5354 Sweetwater Road, Bonita, CA 91902\nSweetwater Summit Regional Park\n3218 Summit Meadow Road, Bonita, CA 91902\nChristmas Circle Community Park\n700 Christmas Circle Drive, Borrego Springs, CA 92004\nLake Morena County Park\n2550 Lake Morena Drive, Campo, CA 91906\nHeritage Park\n1381 E.
