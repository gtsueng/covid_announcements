Each year, the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality\u2019s (DEHQ\u2019s) Vector Control Program routinely tests wild rodents to help monitor hantavirus activity. There were a total of 25 detections in 2024 and seven mice have tested positive so far in 2025. However, people rarely come into direct contact with infected animals because wild rodents naturally avoid humans.\nSymptoms of hantavirus usually develop between 1 to 8 weeks after exposure and include:\n\nSevere muscle aches\nChills, fever or fatigue\nHeadache or dizziness\nNausea, vomiting or stomach pain\nDifficulty breathing\n\nIf you think that you may have been exposed to hantavirus, seek medical attention immediately.\nPreventing Infection\nPeople can be exposed to hantavirus when wild rodents invade their living area. Infected rodents shed the virus in their urine, feces and saliva. Once the matter dries, it can be stirred into the air where people could inhale the virus.\nIf people find wild rodents, nests or signs of them in their living spaces, they should always use \u201cwet cleaning\u201d methods \u2014 using bleach or other disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags. They should NOT sweep or vacuum, which could stir hantavirus into the air where it could be inhaled.\nAvoid Exposure to Hantavirus\n\nSeal up all external holes in homes, garages, and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.\nEliminate rodent infestations immediately.\nAvoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent poop and urine.\nClean up rodent poop and urine using the \u201cwet cleaning\u201d methods described below.\n\n\u201cWet-cleaning\u201d Methods\n\nDo not sweep or vacuum infested areas.\nVentilate the affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes before starting to clean.\nUse rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent poop, nests, contaminated traps and surrounding areas, then let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.\nClean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.\nPlace disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard them in the trash.\nWash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.\nThoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.\n\nFor more information, contact the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality Vector Control Program at (858) 694-2888 or visit their hantavirus web page.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250311.09.52.02"}
