For the latest results on election night, you can visit sdvote.com or follow the Registrar\u2019s office on Twitter.\nThe final unofficial election night results may not come in until midnight and will only cover the ballots that could be counted immediately.\nA number of outstanding mail ballots will still need to be counted. The Registrar\u2019s office mailed nearly 250,000 ballots for this election and a portion of those were dropped off at vote centers or picked up by the U.S. Postal Service on Election Day. Mail ballots sent right before or on April 5 have seven days to arrive if postmarked by Election Day.\nThen there are provisional ballots. People who missed the March 21 registration deadline may conditionally register and vote provisionally up to and on Election Day.\nFor those who register on Election Day, they can do so at any vote center. We don\u2019t know how many people might do so, but it adds to the number of provisional ballots.\nFor each provisional ballot, election workers must make sure the voter didn\u2019t already cast a ballot or was otherwise ineligible to vote.\nElection workers must review and process every provisional and mail-in ballot envelope. It\u2019s a labor-intensive, time-consuming process.\nHowever, the results must be certified on April 14, and the Registrar expects to use every minute of the certification period to make sure the results are accurate.\nIf a candidate receives a majority vote, then they are elected for the remainder of the current term, ending December 2022. If no candidate receives a majority vote, then the top two vote-getters will move on to the special general election on June 7.\nFor more information, visit sdvote.com or call (858) 565-5800.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220405.13.02.07"}
