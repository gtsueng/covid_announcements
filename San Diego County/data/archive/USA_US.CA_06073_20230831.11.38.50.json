In 2015, 44 San Diego County residents tested positive for West Nile virus and six county residents died.\nWest Nile virus is mainly a bird disease, but it can be transmitted to humans by a number of species of mosquitoes \u2014 including Culex mosquitoes native to San Diego and, less effectively, by invasive Aedes aegypti mosquitoes \u2014 if they feed off an infected animal, mainly birds, and then bite people.\nIf people who become infected suffer symptoms, they are typically mild, including headache, fever, nausea, fatigue, skin rash or swollen glands. But in rare cases, West Nile virus can make people extremely ill and even kill them.\nProtecting against mosquitoes is always important in San Diego County. Mosquitoes like to live and breed near people, in yards and even inside homes. Some invasive types can potentially transmit diseases not naturally found here including chikungunya, dengue and Zika \u2014 but only if they first bite an infected person.\nCounty officials reiterated that people should help protect themselves from mosquitoes and potential illnesses by following the County\u2019s \u201cPrevent, Protect, Report\u201d guidelines.\nPrevent mosquito breeding\nDump out or remove any item inside or outside of homes that can hold water, such as plant saucers, rain gutters, buckets, garbage cans, toys, old tires, and wheelbarrows. Mosquito fish, available for free by contacting the Vector Control Program, may be used to control mosquito breeding in backyard water sources such as stagnant swimming pools, ponds, fountains and horse troughs.\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites\nProtect yourself from mosquito-borne illnesses by wearing long sleeves and pants or use insect repellent when outdoors. Use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Make sure screens on windows and doors are in good condition and secured to keep insects out.\nReport possible mosquito activity and dead birds\nReport increased mosquito activity, or stagnant, green swimming pools and other mosquito-breeding sources, as well as dead birds \u2014 dead crows, ravens, jays, hawks and owls \u2014 to environmental health\u2019s Vector Control Program by calling (858) 694-2888 or emailing\u00a0vector@sdcounty.ca.gov.\nGo to San Diego County\u2019s\u00a0\u201cFight the Bite\u201d\u00a0website SDFightTheBite.com to learn how to prevent and protect from these mosquitoes.\nHere are some tips to help keep your yard from becoming a mosquito breeding ground.\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230831.11.38.50"}
