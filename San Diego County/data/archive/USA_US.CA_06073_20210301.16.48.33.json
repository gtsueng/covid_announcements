Of those vaccinated to date, more than 272,000, or just over 10 percent of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nOverall, more than 570,000 County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That\u2019s 21.3 percent of those eligible\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represent approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\n\u201cThese vaccination numbers are important milestones in our work to achieve herd immunity, but we still have a long way to go,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cSan Diegans need to stay focused and continue wearing masks, practice social distancing and washing their hands as we protect our health and that of those around us.\u201d\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the\u00a0County\u2019s vaccination dashboard.

While the testing positivity rate for the County qualifies it for the Red Tier, the state uses the most restrictive metric \u2013 in this case the adjusted case rate \u2013 and assigns counties to that tier. Therefore, the County remains in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 7.4% and is in the Red Tier or Tier 2. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance to a less restrictive tier.\nThe California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis.
