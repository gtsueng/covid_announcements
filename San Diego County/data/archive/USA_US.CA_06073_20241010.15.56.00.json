Ten affordable housing developments opened this last fiscal year and 17 more are in the works. The County has invested $314 million into affordable housing since 2017.\nThe Shallow Rental Subsidy Program expanded to help more low-income seniors avoid homelessness. A $500 a month subsidy goes to their landlords allowing these seniors to stay in their homes.\nIn just one year, nearly 1,000 unhoused veterans were permanently housed as part of the Leave No Veteran Homeless initiative. The County and over a dozen regional partners worked together to make it happen.\nThe Board of Supervisors also approved nearly $4.5 million to expand its Mobile Crisis Response program. It uses behavioral health experts rather than law enforcement to respond to non-violent situations where people are experiencing a behavioral health crisis.\nSome people experiencing a behavioral health crisis were admitted to Crisis Stabilization Units (CSUs) where a calm space allows them to become stable. The County has six CSUs around the region and broke ground on its 7th in July.\nCounty Fire celebrated the opening of the East Otay Mesa Fire Station last October and the Sheriff\u2019s Office took delivery of two new state-of-the-art helicopters. One will fight fires and the other will primarily act as a patrol helicopter.\nPhase 2 of the Youth Transition Campus was completed and is now fully operational. The campus incorporates justice reform into detention facilities for young people. For adults who are leaving jail, a resource hub is in the works to help them reenter the community.\nOne Safe Place, the North County Family Justice Center, helps trauma survivors with much needed services. Plans are now underway to open a second location in the South Bay.\nThe County is investing $500,000 to implement the\u00a0Uplift Boys & Men of Color initiative.\u00a0It will connect at-risk youth with wrap-around services, trauma support systems and workforce development opportunities.\nThe Equity Impact Grant Program gave ten nonprofits $100,000 grants each and another ten are under evaluation. The program helps small, nonprofit organizations address inequity in areas like housing, health, education and public safety.\u00a0The County is adding another $2 million over two years to expand the program.\nThe County updated its Climate Action Plan for unincorporated communities. The plan outlines how the County, residents and businesses can reduce greenhouse gases, wildfire risks and protect the natural environment.\nThe County also added more open space, planted thousands of trees, increased the number of electric vehicles in its fleet and built more charging stations.\nConstruction began on a new state-of-the-art public health lab that will serve the entire region. The facility will open next spring.\nAnd the Southeastern Live Well Center opened its doors. The community played a central role in its creation. The County\u2019s sixth Live Well Center offers food and nutrition assistance, family strengthening services, financial and employment assistance, public health, behavioral health, child support, restorative justice, services for older adults and people with disabilities, and military and veterans\u2019 services.\nTwo libraries expanded last year, and a new branch is planned for Casa de Oro. Two parks opened: Four Gee Park in 4S Ranch and the County\u2019s first equestrian park in Lakeside. Three other parks around the region are in the works.\nTo see the full Annual Report, go to the County\u2019s Annual Report webpage.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241010.15.56.00"}
