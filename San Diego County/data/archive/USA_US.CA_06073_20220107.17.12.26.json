That is nearly a tenfold increase in just 30 days.\nCOVID-19 hospitalizations have also more than doubled in the past 30 days, from 320 to 774, putting a strain on local hospitals that are contending with hundreds of employees unable to work after contracting the virus.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now seeing the highest local case counts of the pandemic. COVID-19 is everywhere,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., County public health officer. \u201cThe best way to slow the spread of COVID-19 is to have as much immunity as possible and to take other precautions that we know work.\u201d\nWhile we are in this highly active COVID-19 period, Wooten is urging San Diegans to:\n\nGet vaccinated\nGet a booster when eligible. Boosters are now available and recommended for everyone 12 years and older\nWear a tight-fitting mask indoors when in public places. The state currently requires masks in indoor public places\nGet tested only if you have symptoms.\nStay home if you\u2019re sick.\nIf you test positive at home, isolate for at least five days. A PCR test is not needed to confirm a positive rapid antigen test.\nSeek treatment from your doctor if you have moderate to severe symptoms.\nEmployers should be flexible and if the job allows, let employees work remotely for their safety and the wellbeing of those around them.\n\n\u201cWhile our COVID-19 testing capacity is high, demand has skyrocketed, leading to long lines and waits. Testing should be reserved for those at higher risk of serious illness and people who need it the most,\u201d Wooten said.\nCounty health officials recommend that only people with symptoms needing emergency care should go to a hospital emergency department.\u00a0 People should not go to an emergency department for testing with no or mild COVID symptoms.\nThe region\u2019s health care providers offer testing to members who meet each systems\u2019 criteria. Many neighborhood pharmacies offer same-day testing as do other locations. The County, which has about 10% of the region\u2019s testing capacity, has a\u00a0network of no-cost testing public sites that are both walk-up and can take appointments.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220107.17.12.26"}
