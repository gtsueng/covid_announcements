While this is a critical next step in addressing the long-term impacts of cross-border pollution, I remain committed to continuing this fight and finding solutions that truly improve the quality of life for our South County families.\u201c\nIn May 2024, the County contacted the California Department of Public Health requesting support in addressing the situation. Additionally, a formal request to the CDC\u2019s National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) requesting an Epi-Aid investigation into the Tijuana River Valley was submitted on June 25.\u00a0 The Epi-Aid was verbally approved on July 31, 2024.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe CDC-led investigation related to the crisis will assess household level impacts in the South region of San Diego County in 2024 related to sewage exposure from the Tijuana River Valley, including air and water exposures. It will also look at occupational and other environmental exposures, health effects and concerns in at-risk populations, and identify information gaps, assess community needs and produce household-based information.\nFormally known as a Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER), it will take place as a collaboration between the County, California Department of Public Health and San Diego State University. CASPERs are done sparingly. They are typically conducted when the public health needs of a community are not well known and population-representative data are needed.\u00a0\nThe survey will involve several hundred households and the County is working with the CDC on when the interviews will begin The CDC is responsible for the timing and publication of data and any after action reports.\u00a0\nThe Public Health Services South County website, originally set-up on February 16, 2024, as one-stop location for health information related to the Tijuana River Valley Sewage Crisis, is being renamed Surveillance Bulletin: South Region Health Concerns to better reflect its expanding scope. Among the data currently tracked is surveillance for gastrointestinal symptoms\u2014such as diarrhea and vomiting\u2014among persons seeking medical attention in emergency departments. Also tracked will be communicable gastrointestinal diseases state law requires that medical providers disclose.\nStarting this week, the website will add respiratory syndromic surveillance that tracks reports of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptoms, including reactive airway disease, wheezing, and bronchospasm. The information has been added to address concerns that have been raised regarding respiratory impacts from the odors attributed to Tijuana River Valley sewage. The page is updated each Wednesday.\u00a0\n\u201cRaw sewage flows, and the associated odors and potential for disease, should not be anyone\u2019s everyday worry,\u201d said Dr. Ankita Kadakia, interim County Public Health Officer. \u201cPublic Health Services has worked with the community to address their concerns about this ongoing pollution for more than a year. The expanded website and pending partnership with the CDC are part of our continuing commitment to be responsive and transparent to everyone in our region.\u201d\u00a0\nTo date, no significant unexplained respiratory increases in syndromic surveillance have been observed.\u00a0\nThe updated site also features a link to the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District (APCD) webpage focused on investigations of numerous odor complaints from communities surrounding the Tijuana River Valley. (The APCD is an independent government agency separate from the County of San Diego with its own governing board.)\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240905.13.08.57"}
