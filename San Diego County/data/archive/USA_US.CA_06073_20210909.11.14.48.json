The event will feature inspirational speakers and performers celebrating those in recovery \u2013 whether the journey has only been a few days or many years.\nThere will also be a virtual resource fair where attendees can connect to an array of services such as education and employment support, veterans\u2019 services, financial and legal services, prevention and treatment information, community resources and more.\nOver the past year, the stress and isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have presented unique challenges and stressors for people in recovery and those with a substance use disorder. Despite immense challenges, behavioral health treatment services are now more widely available than ever before. In an effort to keep the community connected to resources and support networks, the County has leveraged technology and is using telehealth to maintain a virtual presence and meet individuals where they are. All San Diegans are invited to attend this inspirational, virtual community event.\nBehavioral health is an essential part of overall health and wellness and is a part of\u00a0Live Well San Diego,\u00a0the County\u2019s vision to improve the health and safety of all area residents.\nSan Diegans with substance use disorders or experiencing a mental health issue are encouraged to seek help by calling the County\u2019s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 or 2-1-1 San Diego.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210909.11.14.48"}
