However, people are rarely exposed to hantavirus because the main carriers are wild rodents that prefer to live in the wild away from people.\nPeople can be exposed to hantavirus when wild rodents shed it in their urine, feces and saliva, the matter dries and is stirred into the air where people can breathe it in. So far in 2020, County environmental health has collected 25 rodents that have tested positive for hantavirus.\nCounty officials said wet cleaning methods include using bleach, disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags.\nHere are tips for people to prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, and how to use wet-cleaning methods.\nAvoid Exposure to Hantavirus\n\nSeal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.\nEliminate rodent infestations immediately.\nAvoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.\nClean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.\n\nUse \u201cWet-cleaning\u201d Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus\n\nDo not sweep or vacuum infested areas.\nVentilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.\nUse rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent droppings, nests, contaminated traps, and surrounding areas and let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.\nClean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.\nPlace disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard in the trash.\nWash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.\nThoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.\n\nFor more information, contact the County Department of Environmental Health (DEH) at (858) 694-2888\u00a0or visit the\u00a0DEH hantavirus web page.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20201223.10.17.18"}
