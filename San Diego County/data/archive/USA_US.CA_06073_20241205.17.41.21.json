The site boasts a new community garden \u2013 just one of seven that County Aging & Independence Services (AIS) helped bring to life.\nAIS used state funds to buy supplies like fertilizer, shovels, trowels, garden sheds and more. In all, AIS supports more than 20 new and existing community gardens in various ways.\nThe Bayside Community Center worked with several partners to build the garden located within Linda Vista Park and celebrated its opening in June.\nThe transformed lot attracts new and long-time gardeners alike. The site also draws in people of all ages. You\u2019ll see families with children, college students and older adults. Some live at the newly opened Levant Senior Cottages nearby.\nTwo of the residents met each other working at the garden instead of the complex where they live.\nAnd that\u2019s where community gardens really live up to their name\u2014they create community. They grow food but they are also places to meet people, socialize, learn new skills and forge friendships.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important to have a place where people can gather and make lasting connections,\u201d said Aging & Independence Director Jennifer Bransford-Koons. \u201cNo matter what your age, community gardens allow everyone to work together side by side, as well as learn from, and about each other, in ways that foster that sense of community we all need.\u201d\nIntergenerational gardens like these are located throughout the region, with one at the Spring Valley Community Center and another at the Lakeside Community Center. The County Library branch in Ramona also has one.\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning about an AIS supported community garden near you, contact Intergenerational Coordinator Pam Plimpton at pam.plimpton@sdcounty.ca.gov.\nAdditional County-related gardens are located at the Sweetwater Community Garden in Bonita, the Tijuana River Valley Community Garden, Los Pe\u00f1asquitos Canyon Preserve and Rancho Guajome Adobe.\nThe County also supports the Master Gardener Association of San Diego County. Visit their site to find additional garden locations, and how to start or restore a community garden.\nThese efforts reflect the County\u2019s commitment to sustainability. It is core to the County\u2019s mission and part of the new County vision: a just, sustainable\u00a0and resilient future for all.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241205.17.41.21"}
