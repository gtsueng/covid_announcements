Initially, the clinic will be able to administer 750 doses daily but can ramp up to 1,500 per day when more doses are available in the region.\nCOVID-19 vaccines will also be available from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at the patio in the Mexican Consulate, 1540 India St. in Little Italy. The walk-up clinic will have the capacity to administer up to 100 appointments a day, dependent on supply.\nAs part of Project SAVE (Scheduling Assistance for Vaccine Equity), these clinics take steps to ensure an equitable distribution of the novel coronavirus vaccine, including offering reserved appointments.\nThe reserved appointments will be filled through outreach by community health workers or promotoras who are reaching out to people through various ways, including at grocery stores, faith centers, food distribution sites and housing complexes in different impacted parts of the region.\nThe Viejas Arena clinic will set aside 10 percent of doses for residents who live in communities adjacent to SDSU, as will the existing Copley-Price YMCA clinic. The Mexican Consulate site will serve members of the Latino community, which has been more severely impacted by COVID-19, as well as the general community.\nAppointments are required for both sites and can be made by visiting www.vaccinationsuperstationsd.com or, for those 65 years of age or older, by calling 2-1-1.\nVaccination Progress:\n\nOver 1.52 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to the region, and more than 1.42 million have been logged as administered. This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.\nOf those vaccinated to date, almost 502,000 County residents, or 18.7% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nOverall, over 811,000 County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That\u2019s 30.2% of those eligible.\nThose receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s vaccination dashboard.
