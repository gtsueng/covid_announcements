Even more urgent, blood banks supplying those hospitals are often faced with shortages.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat is why for 39 years, the County has hosted an annual blood drive to meet the critical need for donations.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis year\u2019s month-long event kicked off Monday, outside the County Administration Center, with Chief Medical Officer Eric McDonald describing the importance both donating and creating diversity among donors.\u00a0\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to look far to find someone we know in need of blood. My mother needed a transfusion, and we are thankful to blood donors who made it possible for her to be here with us today,\u201d said Dr. McDonald. \u201cIt is important for those who have donated, and for those who haven\u2019t, to step forward to provide a diverse blood pool. Certain blood types and surface proteins are unique to specific groups and if you have someone with a similar ethnic background, a blood transfusion is less likely to cause a reaction.\u201d\u00a0\nTo help spur regional donations, the County partnered last year with the San Diego Blood Bank, a Live Well San Diego partner, to create the Community Guardians Program. The project is dedicated to promoting and expanding blood donations.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe County drive is one of the largest and most successful collection events organized by the San Diego Blood Bank. Everyone is welcome, including non-County employees, to sign up to donate.\u00a0\nBlood Drives at County of San Diego Locations:\u00a0\nCOUNTY ADMINISTRATION CENTER | BOOK NOW\u202f\nMON, APR 3 | 9:30 am-4 pm | Mobile parked in front on Pacific Hwy., 1600 Pacific Hwy, San Diego, CA 92101\u202f\u00a0\nFALLBROOK COMMUNITY CENTER | BOOK NOW\u202f\nMON, APR 3 | 11:30 pm-4:30 pm | Parking Lot, 341 Heald Ln., Fallbrook, CA 92028\u202f\u00a0\nJULIAN LIBRARY | BOOK NOW\u202f\nWED, APR 5 | 12 am-5 pm | 1850 Highway 78, Julian, CA 92036\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nCOUNTY OPERATIONS CENTER | BOOK NOW\u202f\nTHUR, APR 6 | 9 am-3 pm | Main Entrance Cul-de-Sac, 5560 Overland Ave., San Diego, CA 92123\u202f\u00a0\nEAST REGION LIVE WELL CENTER | BOOK NOW\u202f\nMON, APR 10 | 9 am-2:30pm | Parking Lot, 367 N.
