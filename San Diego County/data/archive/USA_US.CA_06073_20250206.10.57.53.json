None were vaccinated. \u00a0\n\u201cThese recent flu deaths among our youth are tragic and concerning as we head into what historically is the peak of flu season,\u201d said Dr. Ankita Kadakia, Interim Public Health Officer. \u201cThe flu vaccine is the best protection against getting seriously sick and preventing death. This has been a particularly long and difficult flu season compared to recent years and it\u2019s not over yet. I highly encourage the flu vaccine, it\u2019s not too late.\u201d\u00a0\nIn San Diego County, nearly 80 percent of 5- to 17-year-olds have not received this flu season\u2019s vaccine. \u00a0\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot yearly since the components of the vaccine change year to year to match the circulating strains. \u00a0\nThe influenza vaccine is available at doctors\u2019 offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County\u2019s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County\u2019s\u202fFlu Vaccine Locations\u202fpage, myturn.ca.gov, or call 2-1-1 San Diego.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nIn addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\nWash hands thoroughly and often\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\n\nUse hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands\u202f\u00a0\n\n\nStay away from sick people\u202f\u00a0\n\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth\u202f\u00a0\n\n\nClean commonly touched surfaces\u202f\u00a0\n\n\nIf you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others\u202f\u00a0\n\nCounty Health and Human Services Agency publishes the\u202fRespiratory Viruses Surveillance report,\u202fwhich tracks key flu, COVID-19, and RSV indicators and summarizes respiratory virus surveillance in the region.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nIn total, there have been 73 people who have died from the flu this flu season. Most were people 50 years and older.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250206.10.57.53"}
