The agency oversees numerous programs and has nearly 8,000 employees who directly provide services to more than a third of the region\u2019s residents.\n\u201cHaving worked with Dr. McDonald for more than 10 years, I have personally experienced his calm, insightful leadership,\u201d said Robbins-Meyer. \u201cHe is community focused and inspires confidence as we undertake everyday activities and during emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. I am grateful he has agreed to step in and provide his vision as we chart the course for the Agency\u2019s future.\u201d\nThe appointment is to replace Director Nick Macchione, who announced his retirement on May 31, effective June 27.\nDr. McDonald\u2019s selection was endorsed by County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Nora Vargas.\n\u201cThe passion and commitment I have experienced with the HHSA team as we expand the delivery and availability of services has been inspiring,\u201d said Chairwoman Vargas. \u201cDr. McDonald was instrumental in keeping our communities safe during our County\u2019s COVID-19 response and I am excited to see him step in as interim leader. I\u2019m eager to get to work with our community partners and my colleagues on the Board to support the CAO\u2019s search for a future Agency director.\u201d\nFollowing a distinguished 24-year career in the U.S. Navy, Dr. McDonald joined the County in 2010 as a deputy public health officer. In 2015, he became the medical director of Epidemiology and Immunization Services and was promoted in 2021 as the Agency\u2019s chief medical officer and director of the newly established Medical Care Services Department.\n\u201cI am very honored to accept this interim position as our Agency and the County experience leadership transitions on several fronts,\u201d said Dr. McDonald. \u201cMy focus will be on ensuring the incredible positive momentum continues in the Agency\u2019s work with the community to improve wellbeing for all San Diegans, delivering services and solving problems in an evidence-based way.\u201d\nThe Health and Human Services Agency operates programs designed to help all 3.3 million San Diego County residents live well. Its eight service departments include Self-Sufficiency Services, Aging & Independence Services, Behavioral Health Services, Child Welfare Services, Public Health Services, Housing & Community Development Services, Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities, and Medical Care Services.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230605.12.29.56"}
