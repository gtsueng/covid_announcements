Users can search for local employers who violated the California Labor Code, the employer\u2019s type of industry, judgment date, and judgment amount. This site will be updated monthly.\nIn the near future, employers can sign up to attend free educational labor compliance trainings for businesses that will be hosted throughout the County and available virtually.\n\u201cThis office and this site are important because questions regarding labor laws come up over and over again,\u201d said Deputy Director Branden Butler. \u201cWe will be a one-stop information shop for both employees and businesses to get answers to important questions about the workplace.\u201d\nFor additional information on workers\u2019 rights and how to file a claim, you can reach the County Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement through its advice line at\u00a0619-985-1597 or email OLSE@sdcounty.ca.gov.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220921.15.08.15"}
