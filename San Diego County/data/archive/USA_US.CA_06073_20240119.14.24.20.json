All basic care supplies such as food, leash, and bedding, are included as part of the program.\nBefore adopting any animal, it\u2019s important to do your research. It\u2019s easy to just fall in love with a Husky\u2019s looks, but it is a good idea to learn about general tendencies of breeds to help make a good decision. Afterall, a pet becomes part of your \u201cpack.\u201d\nGenerally, Huskies have a friendly, intelligent, alert, outgoing and gentle temperament. All animals are different and in some cases Animal Services staff may have more insight on an animal you are interested in and would be happy to discuss.\nIf you\u2019re interested, in being a hero to any of these huskies or other dogs, walk-in hours are from 1 to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at the South Shelter, 5821 Sweetwater Road in Bonita and the North Shelter, 2481 Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad.\nCheck out some of the\u202favailable pets on the Animal Services\u202fwebsite.\u00a0\nAll adoption fees include spaying or neutering, a microchip, updated vaccinations and a one-year dog license for those in the service area.
