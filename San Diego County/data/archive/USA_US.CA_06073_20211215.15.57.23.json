District 1 includes unincorporated areas and the cities of Imperial Beach, National City and Chula Vista.\nDistrict 2 and District 5 are the largest geographic districts, between them stretching from the coast in the west, to the Orange and Riverside county lines to the north, east to the Imperial County line and south to the U.S.-Mexico border.\nDistrict 2, currently represented by Supervisor Joel Anderson, is mainly an eastern district and includes unincorporated areas and the cities of El Cajon, Poway and Santee.\nDistrict 5, currently represented by Supervisor Jim Desmond, is mainly a northern district and includes unincorporated areas and the cities of Escondido, Oceanside, San Marcos and Vista.\nDistrict 3, currently represented by Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer, is mainly a coastal district stretching from Carlsbad to Coronado.\nDistrict 4, currently represented by Chair Nathan Fletcher, includes unincorporated areas around parts of the cities of San Diego, Lemon Grove and La Mesa.\nThe redistricting commission\u2019s final maps and reports are available on the County of San Diego Redistricting webpage.\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211215.15.57.23"}
