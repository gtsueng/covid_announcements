This new service is in addition to the County\u2019s Access and Crisis Line (ACL) at (888) 724-7240.\nWith its launch, 988 will serve as the new nationwide phone number for connecting people to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a national network of local crisis centers that provides free and confidential emotional support to people in a suicidal, mental health and/or substance use crisis, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in the United States.\u00a0People can still call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.\nDuring the initial rollout, calls and texts made to 988 will be connected to a local crisis call center based on the phone number the call is made from and the capabilities of the call center. For example:\n\nCalls made from San Diego County area codes, which include 619, 858, 760, and 442, will be routed directly to the Access and Crisis Line.\nCalls made from other area codes will be routed to the local crisis call center based on the caller\u2019s area code. Texts to 988 will be transferred to a call center equipped for text and chat. In these cases, call center staff will work to deescalate the situation and reroute the client to the crisis call center closest to their current location for local services if needed.\n\nThe 988-dialing code does not replace the Access and Crisis Line, which is already a partner of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.\n\u201cAnyone struggling with a substance use or mental health issue, such as depression, anxiety, suicide, loss, or anger, can call the Access and Crisis Line to speak to a representative,\u201d said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. \u201cACL clinicians are trained to respond to behavioral health-related questions and crisis situations and can provide compassionate and knowledgeable support to callers.\u201d\nConfidential and free of charge, the\u00a0Access and Crisis Line offers support and resources countywide in over 200 languages from experienced counselors\u00a0on all behavioral health, mental health and substance use topics, including but not limited to:\n\nAlcohol and substance use support services\nCrisis intervention\nMobile crisis response services\nMental health referrals\nSuicide prevention\n\nIn 2020, suicide claimed the lives of more than 44,000 Americans, and evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated suicidal thoughts and actions. Locally, 419 suicides were reported that same year.\nHelp is always available by calling the County\u2019s Access and Crisis Line at 888-724-7240 or by visiting\u00a0www.Up2SD.org. Individuals in need of immediate medical attention should call 9-1-1.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220714.09.57.50"}
