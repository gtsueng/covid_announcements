The final six were selected on Friday.\nThe commission is responsible for redrawing the boundaries of the County\u2019s five supervisorial districts. The districts are required to have relatively equal populations and meet other legal standards. District lines must be re-evaluated every 10 years after new federal census numbers are released.\nThe 2020 census will show whether the populations of the districts are out of balance and how the characteristics of the population of each district may have changed.\nNearly 300 residents applied for the commission. The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors selected 60 of the most qualified applicants. Staff then drew eight names from the pool during two random drawings at the Oct. 13 Board of Supervisors meeting.\nThe eight new commissioners had the responsibility of selecting the remaining six members based on a number of requirements specified by the California Elections Code.\nThe law requires the new commissioners\u2019 political party registration to be as proportional as possible to the number of County voters registered with each political party or registered as no party preference.\nCommissioners are also required to have relevant experience, analytical skills, the ability to be impartial and experience that demonstrates an appreciation for the diverse demographics and geography of the County of San Diego.\nThe six who met these requirements and were selected by the initial eight commissioners are:\n\nElidia Dostal\nCarmen-Rosette Garcia\nKenneth Inman\nKristina Kruglyak\nFernandez Ponds\nRamesses Surban\n\nThe makeup of the overall commission largely reflects the county\u2019s diversity.\n\n\n\nPolitical Party Representation:\nPercentage of Registered Voters*\nRedistricting Commission\n\n\nDemocratic\n38.46%\n6 (42.9%)\n\n\nRepublican\n27.60%\n4 (28.6%)\n\n\nAmerican Independent\n3.46%\n0%\n\n\nGreen\n0.36%\n0%\n\n\nLibertarian\n1.01%\n0%\n\n\nPeace & Freedom\n0.38%\n0%\n\n\nNo Party Preference\n28.74%\n4 (28.6%)\n\n\n*Percentage of San Diego County Registered Voters (March 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervisorial District:\n\n\nDistricts\n14 Selected\n\n\nDistrict 1\n3\n\n\nDistrict 2\n2\n\n\nDistrict 3\n3\n\n\nDistrict 4\n3\n\n\nDistrict 5\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRace/Ethnicity:\n\n\n\nCounty Population\n14 Members\n%\n\n\nBlack/African American\n5.00%\n1\n7%\n\n\nHispanic/Latino\n32.60%\n4\n29%\n\n\nAsian\n12.80%\n2\n14%\n\n\nNative Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander\n0.40%\n0\n0%\n\n\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native\n0.70%\n0\n0%\n\n\nWhite (not of Hispanic Origin)\n45.10%\n7\n50%\n\n\nPrefer to Self-Describe\n3.40%\n0\n0%\n\n\nDecline to state\n\n0\n0%\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n*Population source: SANDAG (https://datasurfer.sandag.org/).\n\n\n\nThe commission is evenly split between seven women and seven men. The average age is 58 years old.\nThe full commission will hold its next meeting in mid-December. The public may sign up for email updates, watch virtually or participate via teleconference.\nBefore the Redistricting Commission draws a draft map, it must hold at least seven public hearings with at least one hearing in each supervisorial district. Other meetings, dates and times are at the discretion of the commission.\nThe group will review the new census data when it\u2019s released and start the process on redrawing new maps for the five supervisorial districts. The maps must be completed by Dec. 15, 2021.\nFor additional information, email redistricting@sdcounty.ca.gov.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20201125.10.22.17"}
