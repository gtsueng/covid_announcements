It is currently working to build a roadmap, or\u00a0Housing Blueprint, to guide its response to the housing crisis. This month, the County Board of Supervisors made $25 million available for affordable housing developments through the County\u2019s Innovative Housing Trust Fund, administered by the County\u2019s Housing and Community Development Services.\nIn October 2022, the County announced a goal of working with the City of San Diego to\u00a0build 10,000 affordable housing units by 2030 on publicly owned land.\nThe County also spent millions of dollars and worked with numerous other cities and organizations last year to build housing to help people with low incomes, people experiencing homelessness, seniors and veterans. There were affordable housing communities\u00a0in City Heights, in\u00a0Carlsbad,\u00a0Vista\u00a0and\u00a0downtown San Diego. In a first-of-its-kind project for the County, it used its own\u00a0surplus property to begin transforming an empty lot into a site for low-income affordable housing.\nSince 2017, the County has leveraged about $1.9 billion in federal and state funding by\u00a0investing more than $241 million on 50 affordable housing projects\u00a0in 30 communities. Many are completed, others are under construction, and more are on the way.\nBeyond funding the development of housing units, the County, through its Planning & Development Services, is streamlining permitting processes, providing ADU fee waivers and pre-approved ADU plans, working to identify areas where the development of housing may be incentivized and taking other steps to facilitate housing production.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230503.15.15.26"}
