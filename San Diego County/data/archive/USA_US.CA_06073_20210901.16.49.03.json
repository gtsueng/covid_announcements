Most of the deaths occurred in late August. Forty-one had underlying medical conditions, four did not and four had medical history pending.\nOf the 49 deaths, 12 were 80 years of age or older, 13 were in their 70s, 12 were in their 60s, seven were in their 50s and five were in their 40s.\n\u201cThese deaths are very tragic because they could have been prevented,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cWe now have very safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19. These deaths should not have occurred.\u201d\nMost of the deaths being reported now have been San Diegans who were not vaccinated.\nPublic health officials expected that more people would get vaccinated after the Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to the Pfizer vaccine on Aug. 23. The region has seen a slight uptick in vaccinations.\nAn average of 3,749 San Diegans got their first doses daily between Aug. 23 and Aug. 28. In comparison, an average of 3,651 people received their first shot between Aug. 17 and Aug. 22.\n\u201cUnvaccinated San Diegans are primarily the ones ending up in the hospital and, unfortunately, dying,\u201d Wooten said.\nNo-cost COVID-19 vaccines are widely available in the region. They can be found at medical providers, retail pharmacies, community clinics and County public health centers for people who do not have a medical provider.
