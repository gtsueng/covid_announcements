COVID-19 cases will surpass 10,000 for the month of November, far exceeding the 7,482 cases recorded in October.\nFlu cases are also continuing to increase, reaching 2,694 last week, up from 2,375 the previous week. For the season to date, San Diego County has recorded 12,946 cases of the flu compared to 424 at this time last year.\nSan Diegans are urged to get their flu and COVID vaccines before the peak holiday period. It takes two weeks until the body reaches full immunity.\n\u201cThe time to act is now,\u201d said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. \u201cGet your flu and COVID vaccines as soon as you can and keep yourself and your loved ones safe this holiday season. And remember that masks help reduce spreading both the flu and COVID-19.\u201d\nCOVID-19 and flu vaccines are widely available across the region at pharmacies, medical centers and clinics. The two vaccines can be administered during the same visit. It is important to note that the COVID-19 primary vaccine series or booster does not protect against the flu and the flu vaccine does not protect people against COVID-19. Therefore, it is recommended that eligible San Diegans get vaccinated against both viruses.\nTreatment Options\nSymptomatic patients with a positive COVID-19 test result, including pregnant persons and children, should be evaluated to see if they are eligible for treatment with one of the National Institutes of Health recommended treatment options, which currently for those not hospitalized are nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and remdesivir (Veklury).\nEarly COVID-19 treatment in multi-generational families, especially families of color, protects vulnerable individuals like older family members and those with underlying medical conditions.\nTesting and treatment are available at no cost by calling 1-888-634-1123\u202fto schedule an appointment at an OptumServe site. Appointments can also be made online.\u00a0Call SesameCare at\u202f1-888-897-1244\u202fto schedule a no-cost telehealth visit, which includes a prescription for treatment. Appointments can also be made online.\nCOVID-19 Vaccination Progress:\n\nClose to 2.69 million or 80.4% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.\nBivalent boosters administered: 422,594 or 17% of 2,492,144 eligible San Diegans.\nMore vaccination information can be found at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.\n\nCOVID-19 Deaths:\n\nSeven additional deaths were reported since the last report on Nov. 23, 2022.
