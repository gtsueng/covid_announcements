Located on Harding Street and Oak Avenue, Windsor Pointe offers 50 affordable homes ranging from studios to three-bedroom apartments. The units are for veterans and their families earning between 25 and 60 percent of the area median income (AMI) and unsheltered individuals living with severe mental illness. Supportive services are available on-site to assist those individuals experiencing mental challenges and crisis.\nThe project is the result of partnerships between the County, the City of Carlsbad, Affirmed Housing Group and other community organizations. The development will remain affordable in the community of Carlsbad for 55 years.\nThe County of San Diego is supporting more than a dozen projects that are currently under construction across the region. Combined, the developments will add more than 950 affordable housing units to our local communities.\nThe Windsor Pointe complex aligns with the County\u2019s Framework for Ending Homelessness, which was approved by the Board last year.\nAs part of the framework, the County has committed to investing more than $53 million to create supportive housing for persons with a serious mental illness who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20221104.11.57.20"}
