The County of San Diego Animal Services is offering a $17 adoption fee special starting on St. Patrick\u2019s Day through the weekend for all animals.\nIf you\u2019re interested, check out some of the available pets on the Animal Services website.\nThe Be a Lucky Charm for a Shelter Pet adoption fee special runs from Friday, March 17 through March 19. Fees include spaying or neutering, a microchip, updated vaccinations and a one-year dog license for those in the service area. The adoption fee for a dog normally costs $75. The fee for a cat is normally $65.\nWalk-in hours are from 1 to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at both the South Shelter, 5821 Sweetwater Road in Bonita, or the North Shelter, 2481 Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad.\nFill out an application online to print or pick one up at the shelter. Applications can also be emailed but it is quicker to go in person.\nIf you cannot adopt, consider\u00a0fostering animals\u00a0or\u00a0volunteering for the shelter. For more information, call (619) 767-2675 or visit the Animal Services main website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230314.13.04.22"}
