He was sworn in by Patrick Casao, Jr.\nDuring his remarks, Supervisor Fletcher highlighted the many ways the County has moved forward in issues important to the County. He also quoted Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\u201cWe cannot walk alone, and as we walk; we must make the pledge that we will march ahead. We cannot turn back,\u201d said Supervisor Fletcher. \u201cOur County government has turned in a stronger direction in the last four years and we cannot turn back. We have to continue those efforts moving forward on a path to a more perfect union and I\u2019m honored to continue to serve.\u201d\nSupervisor Jim Desmond was also re-elected to a second four-year term. He represents the Fifth District which spans the North County from Oceanside, Vista and San Marcos to Palomar Mountain, Borrego Springs and Ocotillo Wells. Rincon Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians Chairman Bo Mazzetti administered the oath of office.\nSupervisor Desmond told the audience he looks forward to working with the board to get things done and solve any issues. He said he works by the same principles as he did during his career as a commercial airline pilot.\n\u201cSafety is number one, number two is proper management of the available resources, and quality of life with common sense and practical solutions. That is what I am going to continue in the future,\u201d said Supervisor Desmond. \u201cI look forward to working with this board and solving many of the issues that we still face in San Diego County and make it a better place for all. It is an honor to serve.\u201d\nThe first woman to be elected sheriff in San Diego County was ceremonially sworn into office. Sheriff Kelly A. Martinez takes over for interim Sheriff Anthony Ray. He was appointed last March after Sheriff Bill Gore resigned. Sheriff Martinez was sworn in by San Diego Superior Court Judge Michael S. Groch.\nCounty District Attorney Summer Stephan won a second term of office. She was sworn in by San Diego Superior Court Presiding Judge Michael T. Smyth.\nBoth Sheriff Martinez and D.A. Stephan will serve a six-year term. A new state law extended the four-year term to six for sheriffs and district attorneys elected in 2022. The six-year term will put future law enforcement elections on track with presidential elections.\nJordan Marks was elected to his first term in office as Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk.
