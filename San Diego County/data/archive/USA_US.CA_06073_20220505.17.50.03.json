Laguna on Wednesday celebrated the completion of the County\u2019s highest elevation fire station, sitting at about 6,000 feet.\n\u201cI am honored to recognize the grand opening of Mt. Laguna Fire Station #49,\u201d shared Supervisor Joel Anderson. \u201cI am thankful for all the firefighters and staff that keep our County safe\u2014and I am hopeful that this strategically placed fire station will help them do just that.\u201d\nThe building is shared with County Department of Public Works crews, who are responsible for maintaining roads, including plowing snow or clearing debris following storms.\n\nhttps://www.countynewscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3785-1920.mp4\nStation 49 has 5,000 feet of floor space including the area for two fire trucks.\u00a0 It also includes sleeping quarters for 6 firefighters, a living area, kitchen, office space and gym. There is also a second story balcony so firefighters can enjoy the outdoor environment. The station was built using fire-resistive materials as it is in a high wildfire area.\nThe site also has very specific lighting systems to maintain the light pollution standards of the International Dark-Sky Association, so it does not impede the research performed at the Mt. Laguna Observatory near the station.\nCAL FIRE San Diego Chief Tony Mecham said, \u201cThe new fire station is the beautiful end result of working with the community and former volunteer fire department to assure the continuance of fire protection and emergency medical services on Mt Laguna.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWorkout room inside Mt.
