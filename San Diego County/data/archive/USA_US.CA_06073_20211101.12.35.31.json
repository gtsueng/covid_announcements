Probation officers monitor the person\u2019s compliance with their treatment plan, DUI program participation, court orders, and their substance abuse by conducting frequent alcohol and drug testing, and home visits during non-traditional and evening hours, weekends, and holidays.\n\u201cPrevention and treatment are valuable tools in reducing DUI recidivism rates,\u201d OTS Director Barbara Rooney said. \u201cMonitoring programs are intended to steer probationers in the right direction.\u201d\nThe probation grant will also pay for operations targeting probation violations, alcohol testing, officer training in Standard Field Sobriety Testing and collaborating with courts and prosecutors to establish probation orders.\nThe grant program runs through September 2022. Funding for the OTS grant program is provided through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211101.12.35.31"}
