Outreach teams there have already started helping people get into housing and cleaning up the riverbed.\nThis newest award, also to the County\u2019s Department of Homeless Solutions & Equitable Communities, will help an estimated 75 people experiencing homelessness along the Sweetwater riverbed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe are looking forward to working with our partners in the Sweetwater riverbed to better understand people\u2019s unique circumstances and needs,\u201d said Barbara Jim\u00e9nez, County Community Operations Officer. \u201cI\u2019m confident that working together, and with these new resources, we will move more people into housing.\u201d\u00a0\nOver the next several months, the County will finalize planning and work with the partner entities to bring together the staff and resources necessary to start work on the Sweetwater riverbed program.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230926.11.26.32"}
