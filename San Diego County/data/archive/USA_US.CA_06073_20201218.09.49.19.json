Bergmann said it\u2019s important for people to monitor their physical and mental health and to stay as connected as possible while staying physically distant.\n\u201cWe are encouraging everyone to be in contact with their friends and loved ones, but to please do it from afar,\u201d he said.\nBehavioral Health Services offers the following tips for managing mental wellness while being isolated:\n\nPause, take deep breaths and notice how you feel.\nTalk or video chat with people you trust about your feelings and concerns.\nDon\u2019t be glued to the radio, TV or other news outlets. Take a break from content that might be upsetting.\nMake time for yourself and unwind. Listen to music and do other activities you enjoy while following the public health guidance.\nTake care of your body and exercise on a regular basis. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity can help to reduce anxiety and stress.\nRest and get plenty of sleep. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time, even on weekends.\nEat healthy and well-balanced meals. Avoid drugs and, if you drink, do it in moderation.\n\nIf you or someone you care about are feeling overwhelmed with sadness, depression or anxiety, seek professional help, especially if distress is impacting your daily activities for days or weeks.\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health resources and support are still readily available through County Behavioral Health Services and its many service providers.\nYou can talk to a trained counselor by calling the County\u2019s 24-hour, multi-lingual Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240.
