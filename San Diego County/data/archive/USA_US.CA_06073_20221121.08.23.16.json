The gifts you send or receive could be carrying hitchhiking pests or plant diseases that could potentially damage the County\u2019s $1.75 billion agricultural industry and our environment.\nThat homemade wreath you brought home from grandma\u2019s could be carrying spongy moth eggs; that citrus you picked from your backyard to send to a friend could be carrying huanglongbing\u2014a destructive citrus disease. Or that beautiful fruit basket you made from scratch to send to a friend could be hiding mealy bugs.\nSo remember.

Don\u2019t bring home a keepsake clipping from Aunt Penny\u2019s holiday wreath, or those bulbs you found in Florida, any citrus branches, leaves or stems from anywhere, or avocado leaves from Mexico.\nDon\u2019t transport any fresh, raw, uncooked, untreated foodstuffs. Same for seeds, beans, nuts, rice, dried fruit, decorative greenery, untreated wood items, animal products or soil from almost any foreign country.\nIf you are traveling and think you may have accidentally packed some plant or animal item away, declare those products when you\u2019re asked by an agricultural inspector if you have anything in your luggage.\n\nFor more information about harmful insects, plant diseases, and Agriculture, Weights and Measures \u2014 and everyone\u2019s \u2014 role in protecting our local environment and agriculture, visit the department\u2019s\u00a0Insect and Plant Disease Information webpage.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20221121.08.23.16"}
