Clinical trials showed that the vaccine series is 90% effective at preventing mild, moderate and severe COVID-19.\nThe vaccine was developed using protein-based technology, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been using for decades to treat diseases such as hepatitis B, shingles and human papillomavirus. The vaccine presents a specific portion of the virus which the body generates immunity against.\n\u201cNovavax is another vaccine option we have to slowing the spread of COVID-19,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cIt represents a new choice for the prevention of serious complications from COVID.\u201d\nRight now, Novavax is only available to people who have not received any of the other COVID-19 vaccines.

For those who received an mRNA vaccine, mRNA boosters are available for people 5 years and older. Parental consent is required for all eligible minors to be vaccinated.\nVaccination Progress:\n\nReceived at least one shot: More than 3.01 million or 90% of San Diegans age six months and older are at least partially vaccinated.\nFully vaccinated: More than 2.66 million or 79.7%.\nBoosters administered: 1,437,457 or 58.8% of 2,443,652 eligible San Diegans.\nMore vaccination information can be found at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.\n\nDeaths:\n\n11 additional deaths were reported since the last report on Aug. 11, 2022.
