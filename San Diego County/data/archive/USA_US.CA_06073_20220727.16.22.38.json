These shots can protect our kids from more than a dozen diseases.\u201d\nAlong with kids, August is also a good time for everyone to revisit vaccine records because it is National Immunization Awareness Month (#NIAM). This annual observance highlights the importance of getting recommended vaccines throughout your life.\nVaccines for school-aged children include DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis/whooping cough), Hep B, MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine), chickenpox, polio and more.\nAdditionally, the HPV vaccine is recommended for children ages 9 to 12, and everyone through age 26 to help prevent certain cancers and infections.\nMore information about vaccines and where to get them is available on the County website or by calling 211.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220727.16.22.38"}
