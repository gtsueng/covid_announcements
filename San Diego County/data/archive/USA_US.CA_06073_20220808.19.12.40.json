Currently, the risk of contracting monkeypox for the public remains very low.\nVaccination is an important prevention strategy to contain the outbreak. Nonetheless, the supply of monkeypox vaccines continues to be low compared to demand nationwide. However, the region does continue to receive its allocation of monkeypox vaccine from the California Department of Public Health.\nWho Is Eligible?\nCurrently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention primarily recommends the monkeypox vaccine for people exposed to someone who has been diagnosed with confirmed or probable monkeypox infection and persons with immunocompromising conditions who are at greater risk of developing severe disease or complications if they contract the virus.\nWhere Is the Vaccine Available?\nThe 1,550 vaccine doses distributed this week reflect the vaccines allocated, not what remains in stock. Vaccines can be found at the following healthcare systems, federally qualified health centers and clinics by appointment only:\n\nUC San Diego \u2013 Owen Clinic (200 doses)\nAIDS Healthcare Foundation Healthcare Center San Diego (200 doses)\nVista Community Clinic (200 doses)\nSan Ysidro Health Center (150 doses)\nFamily Health Centers of San Diego (100 doses).\n\nCounty Public Health Centers and STD clinics also have about 300 doses of vaccine available by appointment only, as well.\nOf the 1,550 doses being distributed this week, almost all are to the healthcare providers and clinics above, as well as a county reserve for close contacts of confirmed or probable cases.\nWhere Is Testing Available?\nTesting is widely available through healthcare providers and involves using a swab to sample suspect skin lesions. People with no healthcare provider, who need testing, can call 2-1-1 to be referred to a provider. 2-1-1 is not presently providing vaccination appointments.\nWhat About Second Doses?\nThe monkeypox vaccine is a two-dose series, administered 28 days apart. Following guidance from the California Department of Public Health, given the low supply of vaccine, the County is presently recommending that first doses be administered to as many eligible people as possible. One dose of the monkeypox vaccine is 80% effective. Second doses will be administered when more vaccine is available.\n\u201cOur goal is to get one dose into as many people\u2019s eligible arms as possible,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cWhen we get more vaccine, we can start giving second doses for even higher efficacy.\u201d\nSince late May, the County has received 4,687 doses of monkeypox vaccine. Of those, 3,251 have been distributed and 2,267 have been administered. The number administered might be higher because it takes a few days for the vaccine registry to be updated. As more doses are allotted to the region, the County will expand distribution.\nFor more information about monkeypox, visit\u00a0the County\u2019s monkeypox\u00a0website, which is updated at about 4 p.m. each weekday afternoon.
