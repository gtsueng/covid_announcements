The County will also be offering vaccinations throughout the holidays at its vaccination sites. Check online here for the days and hours sites will be open.\n\u201cMany San Diegans have taken advantage of the ability to get vaccinated,\u201d said County Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. \u201cBut we can still vaccinate and protect more people. COVID-19 remains highly prevalent in San Diego County, and we\u2019re entering January, the month historically when we\u2019ve had our highest peak number of cases. So please take advantage and complete your vaccinations to protect yourself, your family, and others.\u201d\nCounty officials report that through this week, 80.5% of eligible San Diegans have received their two-shot primary vaccinations, 60.8% have received the primary vaccinations and a booster.

They decrease the chances of getting infected, but more importantly, they effectively reduce the risk of severe illness and complications like hospitalization and death.
