According to the CDC, CVST occurs 5\u201316 people per 1 million people per year in the United States.\nAccording to the CDC, about 6.85 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine have been administered in the U.S.\nIn San Diego County, about 58,000 San Diegans have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and no known severe adverse effects have been reported in the region.\n\u201cThe cases that prompted the pause appeared in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The fact that the six cases of a rare condition were identified after recent vaccination followed by a pause while further investigations occur is a sign that the system works,\u201d Wooten said.\nCOVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials. The vaccines met FDA\u2019s rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization.\nCOVID-19 vaccines have been undergoing the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.\nThe CDC and FDA use VAERS to collect reports from health care professionals, vaccine manufacturers and the public of adverse events that happen after vaccination. Reports of adverse events that are unexpected, appear to happen more often than expected or have unusual patterns are followed up with specific studies. The CDC will convene a meeting of the\u00a0Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\u00a0on Wednesday, April 14.\nFor San Diegans who got the vaccine more than a month ago, the risk to them is very low at this time. For San Diegans who recently got the vaccine\u2014within the last few weeks\u2014they should be aware of any symptoms.\nIf you have received the vaccine and develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath, you should contact your health care provider and seek immediate medical treatment.\n\u201cSan Diegans should continue to get vaccinated with a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, which are now being used at the clinics that offered the Johnson and Johnson vaccine,\u201d Wooten said.\nThe CDC is asking health care providers to report adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210413.15.56.42"}
