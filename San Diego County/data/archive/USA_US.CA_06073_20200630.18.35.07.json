The increase was not as steep as the previous day\u2019s record high of 498. Current COVID-19-related cases in ICUs was at a record high of 182. Four new deaths were reported for a total of 365.\nThe largest contributors to the number of community outbreaks are bars and restaurants, and private residences. The following 10 outbreaks in community settings were confirmed during the last seven days.\n\nWith the increase of businesses and activities opened, people in the 20 to 29 age group are going out more and contributing to the higher number of cases.\nWith the Fourth of July holiday weekend coming up, San Diegans may want to celebrate with friends and family at backyard gatherings. However, the County is asking residents to continue to use caution and, if they must gather, stay with immediate family only for house parties and take all precautions.\nIf you do go out to dinner, wear a facial covering, maintain social distancing and frequently wash your hands.\nThe County is not closing beaches, but cities will have the final say. And County officials say those who go the beach should also take the same precautions.\nRegional hospitals support the latest public health orders.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the goal is to protect the health of the region and our community throughout the pandemic as well as preserve hospital capacity,\u201d said Demetrios Alexiou, president and CEO of the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties. \u201cThe recent trends that we\u2019re seeing is putting that second item at risk. In the past week, we\u2019ve seen hospitalizations go up from 300 or so to well over 400 now and there is no end in sight as those trends continue to go up.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Tests, Cases and Deaths\nCommunity Outbreaks:\n\nIn the past seven days, 10 community outbreaks were identified; four new outbreaks were identified June 29, one each at a grocery store, a restaurant, an animal clinic and a private residence.\nThe number of community outbreaks rises above the trigger of seven in seven days.\n\nTesting:\n\n7,382 tests were reported to the County June 29 and 4% were positive new cases.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests is\u00a04.2%.\u00a0\n\nCases:\n\n317 new cases were reported in San Diego County for a total of 14,149.\n1,770 or 12.5% of cases have required hospitalization.\n485 or 3.4% of all cases and 27.4% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nFour new COVID-19 deaths were reported bringing the region\u2019s total to 365.
