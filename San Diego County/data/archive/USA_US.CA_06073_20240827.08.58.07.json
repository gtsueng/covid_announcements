Eligible adults are persons with untreated schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders.\nFamilies, clinicians, first responders, and others can file a petition with the civil court to connect people, 18 years and older, to court-ordered voluntary treatment if they meet criteria related to health and safety.\nThe CARE Act process is based on collaboration and promotes a person-centered process. The County implemented the CARE Act on October 1, 2023, and recently enrolled its 50th person in the program which is more than all the other participating California counties combined.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240827.08.58.07"}
