The goal is to get San Diegans who are homeless on a path to wellness, stability and finding a permanent place to live.\nOutreach and case management, which includes Naloxone distribution to reverse narcotic overdoses, fentanyl testing and sterile syringe access, will be handled by Family Health Centers of San Diego through a contract with the County.\nFamily Health Centers of San Diego will provide substance use counselors, peer support, mental health clinicians and nurse practitioners for medical consultation.\nUpon initial engagement by outreach workers, clients are welcomed to the new shelter with day-to-day operations provided by Alpha Project which is offering 24-hour staffing to support 44 beds.\nThe new shelter is part of the County\u2019s regional effort to improve access to behavioral health services with its sites and in partnership with others. The County recently expanded mobile crisis response teams, crisis stabilization units and is working to maximize mental and substance use services throughout the region.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211215.11.53.13"}
