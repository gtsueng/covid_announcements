Wakeland received more than $2.7 million in loans through the County\u2019s Mental Health Services Act Special Needs Housing Program.\nSome unique features for seniors include:\n\nAdaptable apartments with bathroom grab bars, large door handles and easy-to-open cabinets\nA dedicated curbside pick-up area next to the main lobby for service provider vans to transport tenants, as well as four van spaces and a separate pick-up area in the garage\nApartments with ADA features for residents with hearing and vision impairments\nAn exercise room to promote movement for able-bodied residents\n\nResidents at Trinity Place have access to services from four high-quality providers:\u00a0\n\nPATH (People Assisting the Homeless)\nSt. Paul\u2019s PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly)\nCommunity Research Foundation \u2013 Senior IMPACT\nAlpha Project Home Finder\n\n\u201cPermanent supportive housing has repeatedly shown it can reduce the frequent need for behavioral health crisis services and emergency room visits, as well as criminal justice involvement,\u201d said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. \u201cTenants report an increased ability to focus on their recovery, reconnect with loved ones, and are able to pursue educational and employment goals. I\u2019m pleased that Trinity Place adds 18 more units to provide this level of care.\u201d\nWilliam is one of the residents at Trinity Place.\nTrinity Place funding partners include the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, Wells Fargo, San Diego Housing Commission, Civic San Diego, CalHFA/County of San Diego, California Community Reinvestment Corporation, Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco Low Income Investment Fund.\nWakeland works with these providers at other affordable housing communities like Trinity Place.\n\u201cCompleting this property demonstrates Wakeland\u2019s commitment to provide affordable homes that help people who are struggling during the current housing crisis,\u201d said Ken Sauder, Wakeland\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cTrinity Place is unique in that it not only gives these seniors a safe place to live, but also offers wraparound services designed to help them live stable, independent lives.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210924.12.56.02"}
