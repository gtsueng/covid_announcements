Thrust into the role as primary caregiver, these grandparents often have little preparation time and face a huge learning curve in today\u2019s tech driven world.\nGrandparents face other challenges too, including finances on a fixed income, physical limitations, housing insecurity, legal support and health coverage. The most common reasons grandparents become primary care givers is due to illness, incarceration, addiction, or death of a biological parent. These difficulties are why 19% of grand families live in poverty.\nPrograms and Resources are available to help ease some of the hardships grandparents raising grandchildren face including affordable, recreational opportunities where grandfamilies can connect.
