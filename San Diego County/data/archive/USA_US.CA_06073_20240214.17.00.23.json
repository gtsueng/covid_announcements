In 2014, the office issued 266 licenses and performed 242 ceremonies.\nSome couples got a special wedding day surprise this year. ARCC partnered with the Larry Himmel Neighborhood Foundation to cover the cost for the first 20 weddings at the County Administration Center.\u00a0\nOn average, the office issues nearly 25,000 marriage licenses and performs more than 11,000 weddings each year. Nearly half of customers who request a marriage license also hold their wedding ceremonies at the ARCC\u2019s office.\u00a0\nFor more information on how to get a marriage license or reserve a date for a civil wedding ceremony, visit the Marriage License & Civil Ceremony website.\u00a0\nBelow are some of the couples who said \u201cI do\u201d at the County Administration Center for Valentine\u2019s Day.\u00a0\n  Joshua and EvelenKierstyn and AaronVanessa and TrystanHipolito and RosaUriel and MelissaJasmine and RicoLisette and JoshMin and ChanjuMassiel and DianaCourtney and AaronMamie and Matthew  \n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240214.17.00.23"}
