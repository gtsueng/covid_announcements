And you want to make sure you\u2019re not sending someone you love something nobody wants\u2014a harmful pest.\nThe holiday season is back. It\u2019s the time when many of us are personally mailing and shipping packages and gifts to faraway family and friends. Or maybe even traveling to deliver presents and bring back home gifts in return.\nJust remember\u2014don\u2019t pack a pest!\nIt can happen. The gifts you send or receive could be carrying hitchhiking pests or plant diseases that could potentially damage the County\u2019s $1.66 billion agricultural industry and our local environment.\nHere\u2019s how. That homemade wreath you brought home from your favorite aunt could be carrying spongy moth eggs. Or that citrus you picked from your backyard to send to a friend could be carrying \u201ccitrus greening\u201d\u2014huanglongbing\u2014a destructive citrus disease. Or the beautiful fruit basket you and the kids made from scratch to send to a friend could be hiding mealybugs.\nEvery year San Diego County\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures inspectors\u2014human and detector dogs\u2014work hard to stop the spread of invasive pests. From exotic fruit flies to the emerald ash borer, glassy-winged sharpshooter and South American palm weevil.\nAnd you can help. Just follow these simple guidelines:\nDon\u2019t Pack a Pest\nIf you\u2019re traveling\u2014whether it\u2019s out of state or out of the country\u2014leave what you find behind. Don\u2019t bring home a keepsake clipping from your grandmother\u2019s holiday wreath, or those bulbs you found in Florida. And don\u2019t bring home or avocado leaves from Mexico, or any citrus branches, leaves or stems from anywhere.\nDon\u2019t transport any fresh, raw, uncooked and untreated foodstuffs. That goes for seeds, beans, nuts, rice, dried fruit, decorative greenery, untreated wood items, animal products or soil from almost any foreign country.\nIf you are traveling and think you may have accidentally packed some plant or animal item away? Declare them when an agricultural inspector asks you if you have anything in your luggage.\nFor more information about harmful insects, plant diseases, Agriculture, Weights and Measures and everybody\u2019s role in protecting our local environment and agriculture, visit the department\u2019s Insect and Plant Disease Information webpage.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241126.11.09.57"}
