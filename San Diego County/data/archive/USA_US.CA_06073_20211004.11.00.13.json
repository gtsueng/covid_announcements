Unfortunately, people experiencing depression, anxiety and other mental health challenges often experience stigma and other barriers to getting care.\nAnnually, the County of San Diego hosts Check Your Mood Day to engage and encourage San Diegans to monitor and assess their mental well-being, as well as raise awareness about behavioral health resources. This year\u2019s event will be held virtually on Oct. 7, in conjunction with National Depression Screening Day.\nThe event will provide a variety of online activities, self-care tips, and resources. Community members across the county are encouraged to take an online self-assessment and participate in a social media campaign, with actionable steps and tips to stay mentally healthy.\n\u201cThe uncertainty and changes over the past 18 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic have intensified mental health challenges for many people,\u201d said Luke Bergmann, Ph.D., director of the County\u2019s Behavioral Health Services. \u201cScreenings are the quickest and easiest way to spot the first signs of what could become a serious mental illness, and I encourage every San Diegan to take advantage of Check Your Mood Day.\u201d\nAccording to Mental Health America, nearly one in five American adults suffers from a mental illness. Despite how common depression is, many Americans don\u2019t realize they\u2019re experiencing the condition, or they suffer in silence out of fear of being stigmatized.\nSymptoms of depression vary but include lack of energy, sadness, loss of interest in activities that previously brought joy, and trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Many signs of clinical depression are overlooked or dismissed as something that will simply pass with time.\nSelf-care Tips \n\nSafely connect with family and friends\nGet outside for walks and hikes\nMeditate\nStay physically active\nEat healthy, nutritious meals\nListen to music and dance\n\nCheck Your Mood Day is part of the County\u2019s Live Well San Diego health initiative.
