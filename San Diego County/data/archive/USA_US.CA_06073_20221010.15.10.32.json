All boxes are labeled \u201cOfficial Ballot Drop Box\u201d and constructed from high grade, heavy gauge stainless steel.\nEach ballot drop box is designed to prevent physical damage and unauthorized access to mail ballots. The boxes feature double-locking access doors, anti-pry door jambs, and other anti-theft construction measures. The Registrar\u2019s ballot retrieval team is responsible for collecting ballots inside the box.\nHow do I return my ballot to an official ballot drop box?\nMark your ballot in the comfort of your home, seal your completed ballot inside your return envelope, date and sign your name on the return envelope, and return it in the mail or to one of the Registrar\u2019s 141 official ballot drop box locations around the county. Remember, your signature is required for your vote to count.\nSelect drop boxes will be located outside and available 24-hours a day up until 8 p.m. on Election Day, Nov. 8. All the rest are located inside and access to those is available during the individual facility\u2019s hours of operation.\nWith that in mind, voters should check each location\u2019s hours of operation before heading out to return their ballot. Find the closest one to you by visiting the Registrar\u2019s online locator tool.\nOn Election Day, Nov. 8, all of the Registrar\u2019s official ballot drop box locations will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\nEarly voting also began Monday at the Registrar of Voters office in Kearny Mesa. Hours run from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. However, the Registrar encourages voters to take advantage of the convenience of voting by mail.\nIf you prefer voting in-person, you may do so at any vote center in the county.\n\nStarting Saturday, Oct. 29, 39 vote centers will be open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Then starting Saturday, Nov. 5, over 200 vote centers will be open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\nAll vote center locations will be open again on Election Day, Nov. 8, when voting hours change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nYou can find an official ballot drop box or vote center near you inside your voter information pamphlet, or you can look it up online at sdvote.com.\nLearn more about voting in the Nov.
