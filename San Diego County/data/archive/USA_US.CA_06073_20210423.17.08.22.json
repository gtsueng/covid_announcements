That\u2019s an average of five children per day and the numbers have steadily increased over the last two decades.\nTo raise awareness about this issue, the County\u2019s Polinsky Children\u2019s Center, which provides temporary emergency shelter to children who must be separated from their families for their own safety, hosted a Children\u2019s Memorial Day ceremony Friday morning. Attendees honored the victims of child abuse and neglect with a moment of silence.\nThe annual flag raising event is part of National Child Abuse Prevention Month, which provides the community with tools that help recognize the warning signs of abuse and neglect.\n\u201cEveryone has a role to play in making sure our community is a safe place for children to thrive,\u201d said Kimberly Giardina, Child Welfare Services director. \u201cEven small gestures can make a big difference, including words of encouragement to a struggling parent or offering empathy and support instead of judgment.\u201d\nIf you have reason to believe a child you know is experiencing abuse or neglect, contact the County\u2019s Child Abuse Hotline at 858-560-2191 or (800) 344-6000. You can also call 2-1-1 San Diego, or check this website for a variety of resources related to child abuse prevention.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210423.17.08.22"}
