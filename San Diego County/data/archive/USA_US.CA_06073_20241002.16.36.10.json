From those 30 blocks, seven households from each block are picked to be interviewed for a total of 210 households. \u00a0\nCounty health officials encourage community members to share their experiences if their household is randomly selected to do the survey.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe responses from the assessment are analyzed and used by public health officials to make decisions. It can help determine what public health actions to take, find gaps in information, what resources are needed, and understand new or changing needs within the community.\u00a0\nOngoing Epidemiological Monitoring\nWhile the CASPER is a point in time assessment of the south region population, the County\u2019s public health epidemiologists are monitoring public health data regionally 365 days a year.\u00a0\nThese disease investigators find, evaluate and respond to contagious disease cases, outbreaks and health conditions in the region. They work to figure out which areas and groups of people are being affected to help keep the community safe and healthy.\u00a0\nAnnually, the Epidemiology and Immunization Services Branch investigates more than 15,000 high priority cases of infectious disease and more than 100,000 new reports of contagious diseases. In recent years, work has surrounded increases in hepatitis A among people experiencing homelessness, Mpox, whooping cough, dengue and outbreaks of norovirus associated with oysters and salmonella with raw milk. \nWhen it comes to health concerns due to impacts from sewage pollution and obnoxious odors in the Tijuana River Valley, a weekly report monitors for spikes in gastrointestinal illness and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms\u202fin south region residents. The website is regularly updated with additional information, including links to other agencies responding to the sewage and how people and families can protect themselves. \nTo learn more about health concerns and impacts from sewage and pollution in the Tijuana River Valley and the upcoming CASPER survey, visit sandiegocounty.gov/southregionhealth.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241002.16.36.10"}
