Now engines at Ramona Fire Stations 81 and 82 will also have a third team member.\n\u201cThis is a great example of two groups coming together to better serve the community\u201d, says Jeff Collins, San Diego County Fire Director. \u201cRamona will gain more firefighters, more paramedics and updated equipment that promotes safety and well-being for our residents.\u00a0 County Fire protects the community, and the Ramona Municipal Water District can focus on providing water and wastewater services.\u201d\nSince County Fire functions through a partnership with CAL FIRE, fire and emergency medical services are still provided in Ramona by professionals from CAL FIRE.\nCounty Fire is also adding an advanced life support paramedic to the area. Ramona will also get an additional ambulance, which will be based at Ramona Fire Station 82 once the ambulance\u00a0 is built and delivered. Six cardiac monitors will be added to fire engines and ambulances serving the Ramona community.\nEventually, older fire engines at Ramona Stations 81 and 82 will be replaced.\nThe transfer of responsibility allows the county to further consolidate and enhance regional fire protection throughout the unincorporated areas of San Diego County and leverage its size to purchase goods and services at a lower cost.\nThe San Diego County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) approved the transfer of responsibility Aug. 1.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220802.15.32.21"}
