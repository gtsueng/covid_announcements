The difference between the two numbers represents approximately what is expected to be administered the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nThose vaccinated to date include nearly 185,000 San Diegans who are fully vaccinated, while 19.1% of the population over age 16 has received at least one dose.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s vaccination dashboard.\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 15 cases per 100,000 residents (as of Feb. 23) and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 5%, placing the County in Tier 2 or the Red Tier. While the testing positivity rate for the County qualifies it for the Red Tier, the state uses the most restrictive metric \u2013 in this case the adjusted case rate \u2013 and assigns counties to that tier. Therefore, the County remains in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 7.4% and is in the Red Tier or Tier 2. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance to a less restrictive tier.\nThe California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, March. 2.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nOne new community outbreak was confirmed Feb. 22 in a daycare/preschool/childcare setting.\nIn the past seven days (Feb. 16 through Feb. 22), 23 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n10,900 tests were reported to the County on Feb. 22, and the percentage of new positive cases was 4%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 4.6%. Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 14,444.\n\nCases, Hospitalizations and ICU Admissions:\n\n454 cases were reported to the County on Feb. 22. The region\u2019s total is now 257,805.\n13,040 or 5.1% of all cases have required hospitalization.\n1,578 or 0.6% of all cases and 12.1% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\n29 new COVID-19 deaths were reported Feb. 22. The region\u2019s total is 3,218.\n20 men and nine women died between Dec. 7 and Feb. 21.\nOf the 29 deaths reported Feb. 22, 11 people who died were 80 years or older, five were in their 70s, nine were in their 60s and four were in their 50s.\nAll had underlying medical conditions.\n\nMore Information:\nThe more detailed data summaries found on the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0are updated around 5 p.m. daily.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210223.17.58.07"}
