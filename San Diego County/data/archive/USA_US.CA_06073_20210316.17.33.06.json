She said studies show having books to read in homes improves learning success and a \u201clittle libraries\u201d initiative could help put more books in homes.\nLittle libraries are mailbox like structures put up in communities to create neighborhood book exchanges where people can freely borrow or leave books for others to read. They can be found all around San Diego County, but Vargas said there are just four in her District 1, serving a population of roughly 650,000.\n\u201cResidents can borrow books as they like and return them afterward as an honor-based system,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cThe motto being \u2018take a book and share a book.\u2019\u201d\nWith the Board\u2019s vote Tuesday, the County Library will work with the San Diego Council on Literacy, nonprofits like the national Little Free Library Organization, the County\u2019s Friends of Library groups, and volunteer groups to increase the number of little libraries.\n\u201cThe reality is there are vast disparities,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cAnd many communities\u2019 children don\u2019t have access to age-appropriate books at home, which causes them to fall behind. This initiative today is going to address disparities seen in disadvantaged communities by promoting and encouraging reading from home and by creating more access to literature.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210316.17.33.06"}
