More than 4 million acres burned across the state, which was double the previous record set in 2008.\nWith continued dry conditions and temperatures above normal for this time of year, the upcoming 2021 wildfire season could be even more catastrophic and devastating than last year. San Diego County residents can play an important role in preparing for and preventing wildfires, and now is the time to ensure there is adequate defensible space around homes and buildings, to make homes more fire-resistant and to have a personal disaster plan.\nThis is especially important since many county residents live in high-risk fire zones. Fire prevention tools such as protective fuel breaks, fire-resistant landscaping, and home hardening for their safety and survival. These tools work together to build more fire-resilient communities.\nTo protect their home during a fire, the single most important thing a person can do is to create\u00a0defensible space\u00a0around their home; 100 feet is required by state law. It is important to remember that any clearance work involving any type of mower or power equipment should only be done during non-critical fire conditions because it can actually spark a fire.\nResidents who are physically and financially unable to create and maintain defensible space around their home may be able to receive assistance through the County\u2019s Defensible Space Assistance Program.\nIndividuals and families are also urged to have an\u00a0emergency plan\u00a0and practice it regularly so it\u2019s not unfamiliar in a high-stress situation like a fast-approaching wildfire. This plan should include identified evacuation routes and designated meeting locations outside of your home and neighborhood, and a list of local and out-of-area emergency contacts. \u00a0Owners of large animals such as horses or livestock should also have an evacuation plan and know when to leave in an emergency.\nIt\u2019s also important to prepare an emergency kit in advance with important supplies, including copies of important documents, photos, non-perishable foods, water, extra clothes, medications and medical equipment, phone chargers, extra batteries, and supplies for pets.\nLastly, residents also encouraged to register their cell phones on\u00a0AlertSanDiego, the county\u2019s emergency notification system and download the\u00a0SD Emergency App\u00a0at no cost. An\u00a0emergency plan template\u00a0is available in English, Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Japanese, Arabic, traditional and simplified Chinese, Farsi, French, Korean, Somali, and in English and Spanish an audio versions.\nTo learn more about how to\u00a0prepare before a fire\u00a0and what to do during a fire situation, visit ReadySanDiego.org\u00a0and ReadyforWildfire.org.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210503.15.11.44"}
