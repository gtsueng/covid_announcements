About one in five people who are infected develop a fever and other symptoms such as headache, nausea, fatigue, skin rash or swollen glands. About 1 out of 150 infected people will develop serious illness.\nCounty public health and environmental health officials say the best way for people to protect themselves against the virus is to follow the County\u2019s Prevent, Protect, Report guidelines. These guidelines can also help county residents protect themselves from mosquitoes that transit West Nile virus as well as invasive\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes that can transmit tropical diseases, such as Zika, dengue and chikungunya, if they first bite an infected person and then bite non-infected people.\nPrevent mosquito breeding\nDump out or remove any item inside or outside of homes that can hold water, such as plant saucers, rain gutters, buckets, garbage cans, toys, old tires, and wheelbarrows. Mosquito fish, available for free by contacting the Vector Control Program, may be used to control mosquito breeding in backyard water sources such as unused swimming pools, ponds, fountains, and horse troughs. Mosquito Fish Distribution Locations (sandiegocounty.gov)\nProtect Yourself from Mosquito Bites\nProtect yourself from mosquito-borne illnesses by wearing long sleeves and pants or use repellent when outdoors. Use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Make sure screens on windows and doors are in good condition and secured to keep insects out.\nReport Possible Mosquito Activity\nReport increased mosquito activity, or neglected, green swimming pools and other mosquito-breeding sources, as well as dead birds \u2014 dead crows, ravens, jays, hawks and owls \u2014 to Environmental Health\u2019s Vector Control Program by calling (858) 694-2888 or emailing\u00a0vector@sdcounty.ca.gov.
