Winkler is best known for his role as Arthur Fonzarelli, aka \u201cThe Fonz,\u201d on the TV show Happy Days.\nWinkler shared his thoughts and experiences about resiliency during difficult times, serving the community and enjoying the aging process.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a choice, your glass is either half full or half empty and it is how you look at it, not how anybody else looks at it,\u201d Winkler said.\nThe Vital Aging conference made its return virtually after a one-year hiatus due to COVID-19. Winkler and the other speakers addressed a variety of subjects, aiming to inspire attendees to re-energize their lives so they can thrive again after spending much of the last year at home.\nAmong his tips for living longer and healthier lives, Winkler recommended to stay connected and to \u201cnot allow your brain to go idle.\u201d He also encouraged people to focus on what they can do, instead of what they are unable to do.\n\u201cDon\u2019t take the fact that something is not working and say everything is not working,\u201d Winkler said. \u201cYou take something that is not working, you acknowledge it, and you take all the things that are working, and you keep them working. You are in control!\u201d\nIf you missed the livestream of the event, it is not too late to watch some of the highlights.
