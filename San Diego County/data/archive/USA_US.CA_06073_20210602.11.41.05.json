Boundary lines can also shape a community\u2019s ability to elect the representative of their choice.\nCommissioners from each of the County\u2019s five supervisorial districts will give the informational presentations. Everyone is welcome to attend any or all of the virtual meetings.\nThe IRC Education Tour meetings take place:\n\nJune 3 from 12:00-1:00 pm (District 5)\nJune 8 from 6:00-7:00 pm (District 4)\nJune 16 from 4:00-5:00 pm (District 1)\nJune 23 from 12:00-1:00 pm (District 3)\nJune 30 from 12:00-1:00 pm (District 2)\n\nFor more information and a meeting link, RSVP at the IRC website. To request live language interpretation, call (619) 409-3003 or send an email at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting to redistricting@sdcounty.ca.gov.\nThe meetings are informational only and not Independent Redistricting Commission hearings. Commissioners cannot accept any public input on maps, district boundaries or communities of interest.\nThe public can give their input at the redistricting website, email redistricting@sdcounty.ca.gov or mail comments to: Independent Redistricting Commission, c/o Clerk of the Board, 1600 Pacific Highway, Room 402, San Diego, CA 92101.
