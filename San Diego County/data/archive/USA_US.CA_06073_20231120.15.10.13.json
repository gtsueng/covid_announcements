Or maybe even travel like Santa to deliver them in person and bring back gifts in return.\nJust remember. Don\u2019t pack a pest!\nIt can happen. The gifts you send or receive could be carrying hitchhiking pests or plant diseases that could potentially damage the County\u2019s $1.78 billion agricultural industry and our environment.\nFor example, that homemade wreath you brought home from grandma\u2019s could be carrying spongy moth eggs. That citrus you picked from your backyard to send to a friend could be carrying huanglongbing\u2014a destructive citrus disease. Or that beautiful fruit basket you made from scratch to send to a friend could be hiding mealybugs.\nEvery year San Diego County\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures inspectors\u2014human and detector dogs\u2014work hard to stop the spread of invasive pests. From exotic fruit flies to the emerald ash borer, glassy-winged sharpshooter, and South American palm weevil.\nHow can you help? Follow these simple guidelines:\nDon\u2019t Pack a Pest\n\nIf you\u2019re traveling\u2014whether it\u2019s out of state or out of the country\u2014leave what you find behind. Don\u2019t bring home a keepsake clipping from Aunt Kathy\u2019s holiday wreath, or those bulbs you found in Florida. And don\u2019t bring home any citrus branches, leaves or stems from anywhere, or avocado leaves from Mexico.\nDon\u2019t transport any fresh, raw, uncooked and untreated foodstuffs. That goes for seeds, beans, nuts, rice, dried fruit, decorative greenery, untreated wood items, animal products or soil from almost any foreign country.\nIf you are traveling and think you may have accidentally packed some plant or animal item away? Declare them when an agricultural inspector asks you if you have anything in your luggage.\n\nFor more information about harmful insects, plant diseases, Agriculture, Weights and Measures and everybody\u2019s role in protecting our local environment and agriculture, visit the department\u2019s\u00a0Insect and Plant Disease Information webpage.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231120.15.10.13"}
