It\u2019s more about anticipating the future.\nNational Weather Service Warning Coordination Meteorologist Alex Tardy, who gave a presentation to the room of emergency managers and to internet participants, agreed that the winter outlook has always been about the highest probability, but last year\u2019s record wet 2022-23 winter and the very dry 2015-16 winters proved the opposite of the highest probability occurring across southern California.\n\u201cWe are having an El Ni\u00f1o winter, but we don\u2019t know the impacts it will have on rain and snow levels,\u201d Tardy said. \u201cWe have a slight chance of being wetter than average, 30 to 40 percent is the probability. So, it\u2019s a very high uncertainty for the upcoming winter.\u201d\nHe noted that they predict there will be six atmospheric rivers, while last year there were 13 and it was one of the wettest winters on record in San Diego history. While long-term predictions have not improved recently, the forecasts within a week have much-improved accuracy, Tardy said.\nRea said even if they can\u2019t provide a definitive forecast, the idea behind the winter workshop is for emergency management professionals to have the opportunity to refresh their knowledge of the tools and resources available in the region to prepare for winter weather and to reestablish connections so they can coordinate for the winter weather season.\nThe workshop included an introduction to the County\u2019s ALERT Flood Warning System, the flood gauges, and cameras available, and information on the region\u2019s water supply, reservoir, and drought status from the San Diego County Water Authority. There were also presentations from County Public Works on road crew response during storm events, from CAL FIRE/San Diego County Fire on regional preparedness, swift water response and partners including the San Diego Lifeguard Swiftwater/Flood Rescue Team, and from the County\u2019s Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities on how they help get the word out to people who are experiencing homelessness in a local disaster.\n\u201cFor me, it was really important to come because I\u2019m new to California. The weather patterns are really different than what I\u2019m used to on the East Coast,\u201d said Edward Kramer, emergency manager for the City of Vista. \u201cThe panel was a broad range of people. It was really informative.\u201d\nFor information on how to prepare at home for rain and flooding, visit AlertSanDiego.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231017.17.52.39"}
