During his intake examination, a medical team member noticed that he was a healthy dog who didn\u2019t bear weight on one of his rear legs.\nAfter further examination, the team determined he would need to have his right rear leg amputated, a procedure that would require costly surgery at a pet hospital. Luckily for the dog, who they later named Boone, the Spirit Medical Fund, made up of public donations for animals that need emergency veterinary care due to an injury, was there to help.\nCounty Animal Services established the Spirit Medical Fund in July 2008, after people around the County donated to help a 10-week-old puppy who had been rescued with severe injuries from a beating. Shelter staff named the puppy Spirit because, despite several broken bones and evidence of other injuries, her spirit was not broken and she was still loving.\u00a0 Spirit was adopted by a loving family, but the love for her and other animals continues.\nSo many donations had come in for Spirit that the remaining money was used to help other animals in need, like a puppy found in a dumpster bin with his ears cut off and a dog that was relinquished because the owner couldn\u2019t afford medical care for a broken limb.\nWithout emergency medical care, these animals, including Boone, would not know what it was like to be part of a loving adoptive family.\nBoone had his surgery and his luck continued when a registered veterinary technician offered to foster him to help him with his recovery in a home environment.\nThen, in February, he was adopted by a family that includes two dog \u201csiblings,\u201d Nikita, another Australian Shepherd, and Duke, a German Short-haired Pointer.\nAccording to his adoptive family, Boone is a happy and energetic dog that adjusted to his new home and life with three limbs without any issues.\nThey added that Boone has \u201cbig dog\u201d energy and spends his days running around a fenced 1-acre yard with the other dogs. He also loves to go for car rides with his \u201cDad\u201d and accompany him wherever he can. Lately, he can be found staying cool with his water toys.\nYou can help animals like Boone, through \u00a0adoption, fostering \u00a0or donating to the Spirit Medical Fund. All donations are tax deductible and can be made online or in person or mail with a check made payable to County Animal Services\u201d and \u201cDonation for Spirit Fund\u201d in the memo field of the check.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240912.11.30.27"}
