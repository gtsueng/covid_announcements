The Curtin-Maleng Award is given to prosecutors who embody the principles in the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function, particularly \u201cto seek justice, not merely to convict.\u201d\n\u201cAssistant District Attorney Dwain Woodley epitomizes the principles of integrity that every prosecutor should aspire to,\u201d District Attorney Summer Stephan said. \u201cHe treats everyone with dignity and respect, leads with the clarity of purpose that justice demands and gives voice to the people of San Diego County. He has worked tirelessly to deliver fair and equal justice for all, protect victims of crime, build trust with the public and develop direct access to our office for all the communities we serve.\u201d\n\u201cI am proud to work alongside ADA Woodley to lead the fifth largest District Attorney\u2019s Office in the nation and continue to build a model prosecutor\u2019s office that balances the rights of victims, the rights of the accused and the right of the community to be safe,\u201d Stephan said.\nThe assistant district attorney\u2019s work exemplifies the three important prosecutor obligations: to protect the innocent as well as to convict the guilty; to guard the rights of the accused as well as enforce the rights of the public; and to commit to unwavering legal and ethical standards.\nWoodley served honorably as a public defender and prosecutor in the U.S. Navy\u2019s Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps from 1989 to 1995. He joined the County\u2019s Public Defender\u2019s Office first, then the DA\u2019s Office as a deputy district attorney in 2001. In 2021, he was selected as the Assistant District Attorney. Woodley helped develop and lead the DA\u2019s Community Partnership Prosecutors program that has very successfully connected the public with much needed services around domestic violence, child abuse, and hate crime. He also works the advocacy organization, For the People, on reviewing cases that might qualify for prosecutor-initiated resentencings.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250312.12.03.56"}
