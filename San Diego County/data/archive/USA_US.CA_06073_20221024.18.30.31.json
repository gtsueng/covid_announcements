While students and staff with increased risk for exposure have been identified, other students and staff may also have been exposed.\nTB is an airborne disease that is transmitted from person-to-person through inhalation of the bacteria from the air. The chances of infection are higher for people with frequent and prolonged indoor exposure to a person who is sick with TB.\n\u201cSymptoms of active TB most commonly include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cMost people who become infected after exposure to tuberculosis do not get sick right away. Some who become infected with tuberculosis will become ill at some point in the future, sometimes even years later. Blood tests and skin tests are effective to determine whether someone has been infected.\u201d\nIt is important for individuals with symptoms of TB and those who are immune-compromised to see their medical provider to rule-out active infection and to discuss treatment.\nIndividuals who would like more information on this potential exposure should call the County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621.\nThe number of annual TB cases in San Diego County has decreased since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years. There were 201 cases reported in 2021. Through September, 126 cases have been reported year to date in 2022.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20221024.18.30.31"}
