But counting ballots takes time, and that includes for a special election such as the Sept. 14 California Gubernatorial Recall Election. Here are some reasons why:\n\nRecord high number of over 1.96 million registered voters.\nMore mail ballots issued than ever before because every active registered voter received a ballot in the mail.\nMail ballots can be counted if postmarked on or before Election Day and received on or before Sept. 21.\nVoting locations opened for a four-day period, Sept. 11 \u2013 Sept. 14.\n\nSo, what can you expect on election night?\nThe first set of unofficial results will appear shortly after 8 p.m. This will include mail ballots received before Election Day, including polls ballots from early voting between Sept. 11 \u2013 13. After the first unofficial report, election night updates will add only ballots cast at polls on Election Day.\nThe Election Day ballots come in after the polls close at 8 p.m. There may be a gap in time for the next set of results due to poll workers packing up supplies at each location and driving from 221 voting locations across the county.\nUpon arrival, the polls ballots are scanned, and results will be periodically updated throughout the night until most of the precinct ballots have been counted.\nIt may be midnight, however, before all voting location ballots arrive at the Registrar\u2019s. The final unofficial election night results may not come in until after 1 a.m. and will only cover the ballots that can be counted immediately. You can follow the Registrar\u2019s office on Twitter for updates.\nThe counting of ballots does not end on election night. Here\u2019s what remains:\nMail ballots. The Registrar\u2019s office mailed over 1.96 million ballots for this election and anticipates between 200,000 to 250,000 mail ballots could be dropped off at voting locations or picked up at the U.S. Postal Service on Election Day. Plus, mail ballots sent right before or on Election Day have 7 days to arrive if postmarked by Election Day.\nThen there are provisional ballots. People who missed the Aug. 30 registration deadline may conditionally register and vote provisionally up to and on Election Day. It\u2019s unknown how many people will choose to do that.\nFor each provisional ballot, election workers must make sure the voter didn\u2019t already cast a ballot.\nAfter election night, the next release of unofficial results will be Thursday, Sept. 16 after 5 p.m. Additional postings may occur at the discretion of the Registrar.\nHowever, election results must be certified 30 days after Election Day, on Oct. 14, and the Registrar expects to use every minute of the certification period to make sure the results are accurate.\nTo view election results, visit sdvote.com.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210914.13.25.54"}
