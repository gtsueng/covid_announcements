Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThese San Diegans are at higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19 even after getting vaccinated and should get their booster shot as soon as they qualify.\u201d\nThe CDC says that the following groups\u00a0may\u00a0receive a Pfizer booster shot based on their personal benefits and risks:\n\nPeople age 18\u201349 with\u00a0underlying medical conditions\nPeople age 18\u201364 who are at increased risk for COVID-19 exposure and transmission because of occupational or institutional setting, such as first responders, grocery store workers, etc.\n\nSan Diegans in the above categories should talk to their health care provider about whether getting a Pfizer booster shot is appropriate for them. However, a physician\u2019s referral is not required to get the booster shot.\nWhere to Get the Pfizer Booster Shot\nCurrently, only the Pfizer vaccine booster shots have received full approval from the Food and Drug Administration. However, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson are likely to be approved in the coming months.\nPfizer vaccine shots for children between 5 and 11 years of age are also expected to be approved soon.\nThere are over 400 locations where San Diegans can get vaccinated against COVID-19. They include doctor\u2019s offices, retail pharmacies (Rite Aid, Walgreens, CVS, etc.), community clinics and County public health centers.\nNearly 80% of eligible San Diegans are now fully vaccinated. There is plenty of COVID-19 vaccine available in the region for booster shots and for San Diegans who have not yet been vaccinated.\nSan Diegans are encouraged to visit MyTurn to make an appointment or find a walk-in clinic that is offering the Pfizer vaccine booster shot or other COVID-19 vaccines.
