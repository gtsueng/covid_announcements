This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.\nOverall, more than to 1.46 million County residents have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, including a single dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine or the first dose of Moderna or Pfizer. That\u2019s 54.4% of those eligible.\nOf those vaccinated to date, over 1.02 million County residents, or 38.1% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nThe goal is to fully vaccinate\u00a075% of San Diego County residents 16 and older or 2,017,011 people. To date, 72.5% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 50.8% are fully vaccinated.\nVeterans Affairs doses received and administered, as well as people vaccinated and fully vaccinated, are now included in the numbers and percentages above.\nThose who received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which\u00a0was approved for emergency use by the FDA April 23, 2021\u00a0following a pause to study adverse reactions in a small number of recipients, are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses shipped and the number of vaccinations administered represents approximately what is expected to be used in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s\u00a0vaccination dashboard. For vaccination opportunities, visit\u00a0www.vaccinationsuperstation.com.\n\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 6.2 cases per 100,000 residents (as of April 27).\nThe County remains in the Orange Tier or Tier 3 under the state\u2019s new guidance. The California Department of Public Health indicates that unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as low rate of vaccine uptake, a county will only move to a more restrictive tier if hospitalizations are increasing significantly among vulnerable individuals, especially among vaccinated individuals, and both testing positivity and adjusted case rates show a concerning increase in transmission. This is currently not the case in the region.\nCurrently, the testing positivity percentage is 2.3%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 3.0% and is also in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.\nCDPH assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, May 4.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nOne new community outbreak was confirmed April 28 in a daycare/preschool/childcare setting.\nIn the past seven days (April 22 through April 28), 19 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n16,767 tests were reported to the County on April 28, and the percentage of new positive cases was 1%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 1.5%. Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 13,657.\n\nCases, Hospitalizations and ICU Admissions:\n\n140 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County on April 28. The region\u2019s total is now 275,960.\n15,195 or 5.5% of all cases have required hospitalization.\n1,677 or 0.6% of all cases and 11% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nTwo new COVID-19 deaths were reported April 28. The region\u2019s total is 3,700.\nOne woman and one man died on April 27.\nThe woman was in her 50s and the man was in his 60s.\nBoth had underlying medical conditions.\n\nMore Information:\nThe more detailed data summaries found on the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0are updated around 5 p.m. daily.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210429.17.39.18"}
