The County has a network of free testing sites, both walk-up and appointment-based.\nThe newest testing center is a site at Palomar YMCA in Escondido that can provide up to 800 tests a day, Monday to Friday. New appointments are made available daily and can be booked up to three days in advance.\nHowever, County-operated test sites are not the only testing option in the region. Local health care providers offer testing to members who meet each systems\u2019 criteria. Many neighborhood pharmacies offer same-day testing as do other locations on this list.\nRapid antigen tests, which are available for purchase at many local pharmacies, are a good option if a testing site is unavailable. You can find information on how to best use rapid tests here.\nThe federal government rolled out a program this week that allows every residential household in the United States to order up to four at-home COVID-19 test kits free of charge. Tests can be ordered online at COVIDtests.gov. Those ordering the test kits need only provide a name and address. No ID, credit card, or health insurance information is required.\nAvoid Hospitals for COVID Testing\nMeanwhile, San Diegans should continue to avoid local emergency departments for COVID-19 testing. Area hospitals are experiencing an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations, as well as staff shortages due to the coronavirus and are preserving their resources for patients who are seriously ill.\nThe County recommends that people worried about COVID-19 infection and others seeking COVID-19 testing go to a hospital to be tested only if they have severe symptoms.\n\u201cThere continues to be a lot of virus activity in our community and your best bet for preventing illness is to avoid large crowds, wearing your mask when out in public and getting a booster shot when you are eligible,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cBoosters are available for fully vaccinated people ages 12 and older and provide protection against severe outcomes from the highly contagious Omicron variant.\u201d\nVaccination Progress:\n\nDoses administered: Close to 6.48 million.\nReceived at least one shot: Over 2.83 million or 90.0% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.\nFully vaccinated: More than 2.50 million or 79.5%.\nBoosters administered: 959,697.\nMore vaccination information can be found at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.\n\nDeaths:\n\n24 new deaths were reported since the last report on Jan. 12, 2022.
