She credited the entire team of officers and an additional training unit that just happened to be with them that night for being able to handle the situation.\n\u201cThey knew exactly what to do in this type of situation to help save a life,\u201d said Enjambre. \u201cThis included administering the drug and keeping the man awake and alert until medical assistance arrived on the scene.\u201d\nEnjambre said probation officers having access to naloxone and knowing how to administer it is important due to the recent rise in people struggling with opioid addiction and the presence of fentanyl in many street drugs.\n\u201cWe went through this training initially over two years ago,\u201d said Enjambre. \u201cIn my job, I always do mental rehearsals and I knew that one day I would have to use it. The training helped tremendously for both me and my team.\u201d\nWhile this was the first time probation officers have administered naloxone since the policy was implemented in 2018 and grant funding made the drug available to the department in 2019, the San Diego Sheriff\u2019s Department first began carrying the drug in 2014. Deputies in the Law Enforcement Services Bureau used it a total of 47 times in 2020. Detention Bureau deputies also used naloxone an additional 75 times, making the department\u2019s total reported use at 122 incidents for 2020.\nRuben Leyva, Assistant Chief Probation Officer, said he was encouraged to see officers have success with a tool that aids their ability to serve vulnerable populations who may be struggling with addiction.\n\u201cOftentimes unseen, our officers continually do great work in support of our clients and the community,\u201d said Leyva. \u201cAs law enforcement personnel who often come into contact with people at risk for opioid overdoses, having naloxone readily available and knowing how to use it can help save lives.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210505.13.08.42"}
