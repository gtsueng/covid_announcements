In the last week, 28 cases were reported, compared to seven in the same week last year.\nFlu vaccination status is especially important around the holidays when people stay indoors and gather in large groups, increasing the risk of getting sick.\n\u201cGet vaccinated now to avoid getting sick later and spreading the flu virus to others,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cEspecially the elderly, young children, pregnant women, those with chronic diseases, and people with compromised immune systems should get vaccinated as they are at a higher risk of developing complications from the flu.\u201d\nThe County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the\u00a0Influenza Watch\u00a0weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.\nFor the week ending Nov. 13, 2021, the report shows the following:\n\nEmergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared to 3% the previous week).\nLab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 28 (compared to 30 the previous week).\nTotal influenza deaths to date: 0 (compared to 0 at this time last season).\nTotal lab-confirmed cases to date: 315 (compared to 25 last season).\n\nYour Best Shot Against the Flu\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and the influenza vaccine does not protect against COVID-19.\nThe flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.\nThey include:\n\nPeople with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control;\nPregnant women;\nPeople aged 65 years and older; and\nPeople who live with or care for others who are at higher risk.\n\nThe influenza vaccine is now available at doctors\u2019 offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County\u2019s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County\u2019s\u00a0Flu Vaccine Locations\u00a0page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.\nIn addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:\n\nWash hands thoroughly and often;\nUse hand sanitizers;\nStay away from sick people;\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;\nClean commonly touched surfaces; and\nIf you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.\n\nIn 2020, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. In 2019, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211117.16.51.03"}
