After years of partnership, I am excited to welcome the City of Vista into this incredible collective vision.\u201d\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nLive Well San Diego\u2019s impact is reflected through ten indicators\u00a0that demonstrate increases in life expectancy, quality of life and high school graduation and decreases in crime rates and the proportion of the population living in poverty.\u00a0\nAdditionally, efforts in support of the Live Well San Diego\u202fvision have driven a\u202f13% reduction\u202fin the number of deaths associated with preventable health threats from 2007 to 2022. \u00a0\nThe City of Vista, Vista Community Clinic and the County partnered on the Healthy Cities, Healthy Residents program, a County-funded effort focused on improving public health through community engagement and policy development. It resulted in more sidewalks being created in the community, helping families and children to be more active and stay safe. It also, importantly, created a model for community engagement in the region.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nRecognizing the City of Vista as the 600th Live Well San Diego partner is not just a milestone \u2014 it\u2019s a reflection of a shared commitment to healthier, safer, and thriving communities. Each new partner strengthens the foundation of this regional vision, underscoring the vital role of cross-sector collaboration to support all County residents.\u00a0\nLearn more about Live Well San Diego online and read the Annual Impact Report.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250528.13.33.44"}
