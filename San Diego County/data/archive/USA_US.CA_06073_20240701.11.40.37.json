The warm water causes a chemical reaction that inactivates the medications, making them safe to throw away in the trash.\u00a0\n\u201cThese pouches keep children safe and drugs out of the hands of anyone who could misuse and suffer from ingesting them,\u201d said Caroline Smith, interim deputy chief administrative officer for the County\u2019s Health and Human Services Agency.\u00a0\nIn 2022, 857 people died from an opioid overdose in San Diego County, which is about a 115% increase from 2016. \u00a0\nThe pilot program was approved by the County\u2019s Board of Supervisors in October 2023 and allotted $500,000 from a one-time Opioid Settlement Fund.\u00a0\nMore information on the Drug Disposal Pilot is available on the Medical Care Services website.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240701.11.40.37"}
