The program will be offered from 6 to 9 p.m. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights at the City Heights, Linda Vista, and Skyline Hills Recreation Centers.\n\u201cThe County of San Diego is pleased to help support Parks After Dark that provides a wide range of enjoyable, supervised activities and safe services to our neighborhood children and adults,\u201d said Chair Nathan Fletcher, San Diego County Board of Supervisors. \u201cThe County is supporting programs that improve youth mental health \u2013 and being able to enjoy our parks is one way to do that.\u201d\nParks After Dark is modeled after similar programs in the area, including a number of County initiatives. These programs are credited with reducing crime and creating a sense of community and safe places to gather and play on summer nights.\nSince 2007, the County has conducted nighttime park activities such as sunset hikes, full-moon hikes, star parties, campfire programs, summer movies and concerts. It also has an ongoing partnership with the Parks Foundation under the \u2018Get Kids Outside\u2019 initiative which has offered a series of free or low-cost events in over 20 recreation and aquatic centers across South and Central San Diego.\n\u201cParks After Dark programming provides an opportunity for children, teens, grandparents and entire families to get together outdoors and enjoy fun, safe, community-based activities right in their own neighborhoods,\u201d said Nick Macchione, director of the County Health and Human Services Agency. \u201cThe County is proud to support this initiative because we know that communities are stronger and healthier when people can safely get together outdoors, be active, connect with friends and neighbors and enjoy quality family time.\u201d\nSan Diego\u2019s Parks After Dark program kicks off this week and runs through Aug. 27.
