This year there were 1,203 purple flags, 97 fewer flags than last year.\nThe County Administration Center will also be lit up in purple on Aug. 31 in recognition of those who died from an overdose and their grieving loved ones left behind.\nInternational Overdose Awareness Day is an opportunity to raise awareness about fatal overdoses, eliminate stigma, share information about programs and services, and support those affected by drug-related deaths and injuries.\nAccidental fentanyl overdose deaths remain the number one killer of 18-to 45-year-olds.\nHowever, there is some encouraging news this year.\nThe San Diego County Substance Use and Overdose Prevention (SUOPT) 2024 Report Card, shows that accidental overdose deaths fell from 1,300 in 2022 to 1,203 in 2023, and unintentional fentanyl-caused deaths dropped from 814 to 749.\nFentanyl is a\u00a0synthetic opioid that is up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. It cannot be seen, smelled, or tasted and is often added to other drugs and illegal substances to\u00a0make them\u00a0cheaper, more powerful and\u00a0more addictive.\n\u201cFentanyl is almost impossible to detect on your own so people may not even be aware they are taking it,\u201d said Dr. Seema Shah, Interim Deputy Public Health Officer for the County. \u201cIn some cases, as little as two milligrams is enough to cause an overdose or even death.\u201d\nOverdose deaths are preventable, and substance use disease is treatable.\n\u201cWe know treatment works for substance use disorders and we have to make it more accessible,\u201d said Luke Bergmann, Director of Behavioral Health for the County. \u201cWe need to build connections between the treatment services that we have established and support, and the people they would benefit.\u201d\nAs part of the County\u2019s\u00a0Harm Reduction Strategy, naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal medicine, and fentanyl test strips are available to anyone who wants them.\nSeveral locations across the county offer the public cost-free naloxone kits. Locations can be found by using the interactive Substance Use and Medication Assistance Treatment (MAT) and Naloxone Resource map.\nSimilarly, the interactive Prescription Drug Drop-Off Locator Map guides people to locations where they can safely dispose of unwanted medications.\nSubstance use treatment resources and support services are available by calling the County\u2019s Access and Crisis Line\u00a0at 888-724-7240 or the national Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988. These resources are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and can provide help in over 150 languages.\nToday is the best day to start a recovery journey.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240829.16.02.35"}
