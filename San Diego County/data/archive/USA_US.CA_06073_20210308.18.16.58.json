Also, all currently available vaccines were 100% effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths during trials.\n\u201cSan Diegans should get whichever vaccine is available when it\u2019s their turn to get vaccinated,\u201d Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cAll three vaccines are excellent at preventing people from getting seriously ill from COVID-19.\u201d\nLocal vaccination sites are currently providing vaccine to San Diegans in Phase 1A and Phase 1B. Supplies remain limited.\n\u201cRegardless of which shot you get, you\u2019ll be protected from serious complications from COVID-19 and will be able to protect others who are waiting their turn to be vaccinated,\u201d Wooten said.\nVaccination Progress:\n\nMore than 1.15 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to the region, and over 1.04 million have been logged as administered. Of those vaccinated to date, nearly 342,000 people, or 12.7% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nOverall, more than 643,000 County residents have received at least one shot of two-dose vaccine. That\u2019s 23.9% of those eligible.\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s vaccination dashboard. For details on groups currently eligible and vaccination opportunities, visit vaccinationsuperstations.dom.\n\nA COVID-19 vaccination is administered at the Grossmont Center Vaccination Super Station.\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 10.8 cases per 100,000 residents (as of March 2) and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 4.2%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier. While the testing positivity rate for the County qualifies it for Tier 3, the state uses the most restrictive metric \u2013 in this case the adjusted case rate \u2013 and assigns counties to that tier. Therefore, the County remains in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 6% and is in the Red Tier or Tier 2. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance to a less restrictive tier.\nThe California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, March. 9.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nNo new community outbreaks were confirmed March 7.\nFour community outbreaks were confirmed March 6: two in business settings and two in retail settings.\nNo community outbreaks were confirmed March 5.\nIn the past seven days (March 1 through March 7), 24 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n9,770 tests were reported to the County on March 7, and the percentage of new positive cases was 3%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 3.2%. Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 12,835.\n\nCases, Hospitalizations and ICU Admissions:\n\n307 cases were reported to the County on March 7. The region\u2019s total is now 263,275.\n13,259 or 5% of all cases have required hospitalization.\n1,613 or 0.6% of all cases and 12.2% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nNo new COVID-19 deaths were reported March 7. The region\u2019s total is 3,390.\nFive COVID-19 deaths were reported March 6.\nThree men and two women died between Jan. 28 and Jan. 30.\nOf the five deaths, one person who died was 80 years or older, two people who died were in their 70s and two were in their 60s.\nAll had underlying medical conditions.\n14 COVID-19 deaths were reported March 5.\n10 men and four women died between Jan. 16 and March 4.\nOf the 14 deaths reported March 5, four people who died were 80 years or older, six were in their 70s, one was in their 60s, two were in their 50s and one was in their 40s.\n12 had underlying medical conditions and two did not.\n\nMore Information:\nThe more detailed data summaries found on the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0are updated around 5 p.m. daily.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210308.18.16.58"}
