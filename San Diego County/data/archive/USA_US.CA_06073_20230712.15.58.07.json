The no-cost Mpox and COVID-19 vaccines will be offered by public health nurses from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Appointments are not needed. \u00a0\nInside the festival, the County will also be offering rapid HIV testing on Saturday, July 15 from 12 to 7 p.m. and Sunday, July 16 from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. People can also pick up information on PrEP, Mpox and Take Me Home Testing.\u00a0\nThe County\u2019s Aging and Independence Services will provide information on resources and services available for older adults at the Senior Cool Zone. It will open from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday to provide a free area for older adults to cool off with fans and refreshments.\u00a0\nFestivalgoers are also invited to stop by the County\u2019s Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities booth for interactive mental health activities including \u201cCheck Your Mood\u201d screenings and Live Well San Diego swag bag giveaways.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe JYNNEOS vaccine that helps protect against Mpox is recommended for people at risk for Mpox including men who have sex with men and transgender women.\u00a0\nPeople who previously received the first dose of JYNNEOS should get a second dose of the vaccine. Two doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine increase protection against Mpox, reduce the spread of Mpox and lessen symptoms if an infection does happen. \u00a0\nThe Mpox vaccine can also be given to people after exposure to Mpox to help prevent getting the infection or reduce symptoms if infection does occur.\u00a0\nAlong with being vaccinated, other steps people should take to protect themselves from getting Mpox include avoiding close, skin-to-skin contact, including intimate contact, with someone who has Mpox.\u00a0\nFor more information about Mpox, including where to find the vaccine, visit sandiegocounty.gov/mpox and sign up for text updates by texting COSD MPOX to 468-311.\u00a0\nIn addition, several other County departments are participating in Pride including the Office of Equity and Racial Justice, Library, Human Resources, Probation, Public Defender\u2019s Office and Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230712.15.58.07"}
