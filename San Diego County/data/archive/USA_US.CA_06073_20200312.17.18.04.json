The new Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk East County Branch Office and Archive in Santee formally celebrated its grand opening with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Thursday.\nThe new 25,000-square-foot building features a first for the County \u2013 County Archives. Historic documents dating back 170 years now have a dedicated space of their own. Some 4,400 cubic feet of archival records and microfilm moved from offsite storage to a repository with its own generator, heating and air conditioning system, state of the art fire suppression system and secure access.\n\u201cDocuments include maps, deeds, historic birth, marriage and death certificates, and other official records dating back to 1850,\u201d said Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk Ernest J. Dronenburg, Jr. \u201cThe archives will offer county residents and other users the opportunity to conduct research and view publicly available documents, either electronically or by appointment, based on their physical condition.\u201d\nThe County\u2019s first-ever archivist will manage the repository and help the public gain access to the historic documents.\nThe site of the one-story structure features 125 parking spaces under solar panel canopies, an outdoor wedding arbor and indoor marriage room. The County\u2019s Treasurer/Tax Collector\u2019s office will also offer limited services.\nThe County Archive is the first zero net energy archive in the nation and the County\u2019s sixth zero net energy facility, meaning all the energy needed to run the building will be produced onsite. \u00a0\u00a0The overall facility was also built to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design gold standards.\nFor more information about the Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk\u2019s office, visit their website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200312.17.18.04"}
