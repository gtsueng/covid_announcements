A virtual business recovery center opens Oct. 28 for help in determining eligibility.\nThe SBA acted under its own authority to declare a disaster in response to a request from the Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services, SBA\u2019s Administrator Isabella Casillas Guzman said.\nThe disaster declaration makes SBA assistance available in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San\u00a0Bernardino and San Diego counties. The deadline to apply for economic injury is July 27, 2022.\n\u201cSmall nonfarm businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, small businesses engaged in aquaculture and most private nonprofit organizations of any size may qualify for Economic Injury Disaster Loans of up to $2\u00a0million to help meet financial obligations and operating expenses which could have been met had the disaster not occurred,\u201d said Tanya Garfield, director of SBA\u2019s Disaster Field Operations Center-West.\n\u201cThese loans may be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable and other bills that can\u2019t be paid because of the disaster\u2019s impact. Disaster loans can provide vital economic assistance to small businesses to help overcome the temporary loss of revenue they are experiencing,\u201d she added.\nEligibility is based on the financial impact of the disaster only and not on any actual property damage. These loans have an interest rate of 2.855\u00a0percent for small businesses and 2\u00a0percent for private nonprofit organizations with terms up to 30\u00a0years and are restricted to small businesses without the financial ability to offset the adverse impact without hardship.\n\u201cSBA\u2019s mission-driven team stands ready to help California small businesses impacted by the pipeline oil spill,\u201d said Administrator Guzman. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to providing federal disaster loans swiftly and efficiently, with a customer-centric approach to help businesses and communities recover and rebuild.\u201d\nIn consideration of the public health concerns due to the Coronavirus pandemic, SBA has established a Virtual Business Recovery Center to answer questions about SBA\u2019s disaster loan program, explain the application process and help individuals complete their electronic loan application.\nApplicants may apply online, receive additional disaster assistance information, and download applications at https://disasterloanassistance.sba.gov/. Applicants may also call SBA\u2019s Customer Service Center at (800)\u00a0659-2955 or email disastercustomerservice@sba.gov for more information on SBA disaster assistance. Individuals who are deaf or hard\u2011of\u2011hearing may call (800)\u00a0877-8339. Completed applications should be mailed to U.S. Small Business Administration, Processing and Disbursement Center, 14925 Kingsport Road, Fort\u00a0Worth, TX\u00a0 76155.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211028.15.43.43"}
