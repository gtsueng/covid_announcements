The assessment is part of a CDC-developed survey called a CASPER, or Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response.\nInterview teams are working in 30 single-block areas, chosen in part by the number of odor complaints received from residents. They will visit 210 randomly chosen households to document residents\u2019 health information.\nWhen all surveys are complete, responses will be analyzed by the CDC in the coming days, weeks and months. The resulting information will used by the County and other agencies to make decisions about additional actions and resources that can help the community.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241018.17.15.51"}
