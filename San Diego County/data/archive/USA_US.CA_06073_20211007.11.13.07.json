The agenda is available here.\nCLERB\u00a0was established in 1990 to increase public confidence in law enforcement by investigating citizen complaints against San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s deputies and probation officers. The agency also investigates deaths in connection with the actions of sworn deputies and probation officers. The County Board of Supervisors expanded CLERB\u2019s budget, staff and authority in 2020.\nCLERB is committed to conducting independent, thorough, timely and impartial investigations. It makes advisory findings on complaints, and recommends policy and procedure changes to the Sheriff, Chief Probation Officer and the County Board of Supervisors.\nThe Board of Supervisors appointed four CLERB members on Tuesday filling ten of 11 seats. CLERB is comprised of two members from each of the five supervisorial districts and an eleventh is chosen at large from any of the districts. One seat from District One, which includes Coronado, National City, Chula Vista and Imperial Beach, remains open. Members serve three-year terms.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211007.11.13.07"}
