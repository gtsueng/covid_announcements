The budget also includes roughly 72 new positions, a 0.4% increase.\nThe plan maintains core services and calls for funding to support the County\u2019s budget priorities. They include behavioral health, homelessness, affordable housing, roads, justice reform and environmental sustainability.\nOverall, the recommended budget increase is smaller than previous years, limiting the growth of staffing and reducing spending on capital projects.\nThe County provides many services across the region, including food and restaurant inspections, beach and bay water testing, elections, social services, health programs, foster care, adult protective services and more.\nIn addition, the County provides city-type services for those who live outside of the region\u2019s 18 cities in the unincorporated area, including law enforcement and fire protection, and maintenance of parks, libraries and roads.\nCounty staff prepared the budget using community input collected throughout the year, an equity assessment to evaluate potential impacts to vulnerable populations and additional data.\nAbout half of the County\u2019s budget funding comes from federal, state or other governments. The Governor released the revised state budget recently, and staff is currently reviewing it for impacts to the County and monitoring areas where revisions may be needed pending the final state budget. The overall economy may also affect projected County funding in the next couple of years.\nThe County will release its revised recommended budget June 13, with approval of the final budget by the Board of Supervisors expected on June 25. The budget will take effect July 1.\nLearn more about the recommended budget by reviewing an\u00a0executive summary\u00a0or the\u00a0full recommended budget plan.\nGive your feedback and let us know how you prefer to receive updates on the budget process by leaving comments at\u00a0Engage San Diego County\u00a0now through June 13.\nYou can\u00a0also\u00a0watch, listen and participate in the budget hearing, and the June 25 Board meeting for deliberations and adoption.\nAttend the Meeting in Person\nThe meetings will take place in room 310 at the County Administration Center located at 1600 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92101.\nSpanish language translation services for public speakers are available at Board meetings.\nArabic, Chinese (Mandarin), Korean, Persian (including Farsi, Dari), Somali, Spanish, Tagalog (including Filipino), and Vietnamese translations of the overall proceedings are also available upon request at least 72 hours prior to the meeting.
