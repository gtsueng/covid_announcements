It also celebrates the recovery community and supports both those currently on their recovery journey and those people still struggling with addiction.\u00a0\nEvidence-based treatment and recovery practices are available to help people battling substance use and mental health disorders.\u00a0\nThere are a number of ways to mark and observe National Recovery Month, including these five suggestions from BHS. \u00a0\nAmong these five ways is sharing a spotlight story about a person with lived experience in recovery or an organization doing work that made a difference in a person\u2019s recovery journey. BHS is collecting the stories to highlight the resiliency and the spectrum of recovery in the community. Submissions will be highlighted throughout the year. \u00a0\n\u201cEvery recovery story is unique and powerful,\u201d said Luke Bergmann, Director of County Behavioral Health Services. \u201cWhen people join together and share their stories with one another, it can provide strength and accountability, but more importantly it fosters a sense of connection and healing among the recovery community. It also helps reduce the stigma often associated with mental illness and substance use, encouraging more people to seek the supports they may need.\u201d\u00a0\nThe County\u2019s\u202fBehavioral Health Services\u202fprovides mental health and substance use disorder services to more than 111,000 San Diego County residents of all ages.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you or someone you care about is in crisis or would like behavioral health resources or support, including accessing\u202fMobile Crisis Response Teams\u202f(MCRT), please call the\u202fAccess and Crisis Line\u202fat (888) 724-7240 or 9-8-8 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Calls are answered by experienced counselors, with assistance available in over 200 languages.\u202f\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240911.10.12.33"}
