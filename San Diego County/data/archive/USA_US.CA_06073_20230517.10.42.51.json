She also was the first person who believed me and gave me a voice against my abuser, and she stood right next to me through it.\u201d \u00a0\nWith Abbie\u2019s support, Tianna\u2019s self confidence grew and even after aging out of foster care, Tianna was excited to see that Abbie stayed by her side.\n\u201cShe played a part in my resiliency, showing me that I matter,\u201d Tianna said. \u201cShowing me I can go to college and graduate from a university!\u201d\nAbbie was in the stands cheering for Tianna the day she graduated from Point Loma Nazarene University in the last couple years.\u00a0\nTianna reached out to Health and Human Services Agency Director, Nick Macchione, to convey how Abbie\u2019s dedication to her job made a huge difference in her own life.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThe lives of our children and youth have been blessed because of social workers like Abbie and others on our team,\u201d Macchione said. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough how much I appreciate Abbie for all she has done and continues to do to help our most vulnerable children in the county.\u201d\u00a0\nMacchione notified Child Welfare Services Director Kim Giardina, who was Abbie\u2019s supervisor back then. \n\u201cShe was such a sweet young lady, and it was amazing seeing her blossom into a confident young woman,\u201d Giardina said of Tianna. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day that child welfare staff get to hear directly from children, youth and families about the positive impact we make in their lives.\u201d\u00a0\nGiardina knew this was a perfect time to recognize Abbie with the Director\u2019s Award for her outstanding work. \n\u201cThis was such a special recognition because it came from one of our former foster youth,\u201d Giardina said. \u201cAbbie is very deserving of this recognition, and I think it also is emblematic of the work all our staff do every day.\u201d\nThe ceremony was held April 20th at Abbie\u2019s office in the East County Child Welfare Services office. Tianna handed her the plaque with some words on how positively Abbie impacted her life.\u00a0\n\u201cI have always believed that we have this privilege of being a part of someone\u2019s story, a small piece in the puzzle of their life,\u201d Abbie said. \u201cTo hear how the things I did and said as a social worker created positive ripples in her life and to get to hear that directly from her, meant the world to me.\u201d\nIn part inspired by Abbie\u2019s impact on her life, today Tianna works as a supervisor at Voices for Children training and mentoring Court Appointed Special Advocates for foster youth.\u00a0\nFor her part, Abbie is training the next generation of social workers as a Protective Services Supervisor in the Workforce Training and Development Unit. \n\u201cIt brings me great joy in training the next generation of social workers to make an impact with the families we serve,\u201d Abbie said. \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t always get to hear how the story ends, it\u2019s our pleasure to be a part of the journey.\u201d\u00a0\nShowing compassion has the power to change a life and make waves to positively impact others.
