Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cWhile there\u2019s no vaccine for RSV, ample vaccinations are available for the flu and COVID-19. These vaccines take two weeks to become fully effective, so people should get both shots as soon as possible.\u201d\nWooten also recommends that people, especially those at a higher risk for severe disease, should consider taking extra precautions this fall and winter:\n\nConsider a well-fitting, good-quality mask, especially indoors or in crowded spaces;\nWash hands thoroughly and often;\nUse hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;\nStay away from sick people;\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;\nClean commonly touched surfaces; and\nIf you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.\n\nWhat is RSV\nRSV is a respiratory virus that has been detected in previous cold and flu seasons, but usually doesn\u2019t spike at the same time as flu. RSV can cause significant respiratory problems, especially in young children. Symptoms of RSV include cough, runny nose, and fever. Treatment consists of managing symptoms and, in severe cases, hospitalization.\nRSV is currently inundating local pediatric care providers. Rady Children\u2019s Hospital earlier this week notified families that wait times for care in their emergency room are a lot longer than usual.\nVaccines for the flu and COVID-19, including the new bivalent boosters, are widely available through health care providers, pharmacies, clinics and the County.\n\u201cCOVID-19 and flu vaccines are safe and effective at preventing the most severe disease,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cWhile the flu vaccine does not protect people against COVID and vice versa, it is possible to get both shots during the same visit.\u201d\nVaccination Progress:\n\nMore than 2.69 million or 80.5% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.\nBoosters administered: 1,485,987or 60.2% of 2,469,569 eligible San Diegans.\nMore vaccination information can be found at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.\n\nDeaths:\n\nSeven additional deaths were reported since the last report on Oct. 20, 2022. The region\u2019s total is 5,524.\nOf the seven additional deaths, four were women and three were men. They died between Oct. 9, 2022 and Oct. 14, 2022.\nThree of the people who died were 80 years or older, one was in their 70s and three were in their 60s.\nFive received at least the primary series of the vaccine and two had not.\nAll had underlying medical conditions.\n\nCases, Case Rates and Testing:\n\n1,569 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Oct. 18 to Oct. 24, 2022). The region\u2019s total is now 929,549.\nThe 1,569 cases reported in the past week were slightly lower compared to the 1,591 infections identified the previous week (Oct. 11 to Oct. 17, 2022).\n8,023 tests were reported to the County on Oct. 22, and the percentage of new positive cases was 3.2% (Data through Oct. 22).\nThe 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Oct. 22, is 3.7%.\n\nMore Information:\nData updates to the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0will be published Thursdays around 5 p.m., with the exception of holidays.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20221028.09.25.48"}
