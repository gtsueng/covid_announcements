The land is now managed by the County\u2019s Department of Parks and Recreation.\nEarlier this year, funds were set aside for site inspection and community outreach to decide the future use of the park and meet the needs of the community.\n\u201cThe County of San Diego builds parks in the vision of the community. We take pride in building parks that reflect the essence of each community,\u201d said Jake Enriquez, Region Manager at County of San Diego.\nThe sale of this park land was also made possible in part with a $2 million donation from The Manuel Arango Foundation.\n\u201cWe thank you for investing in this charming Valley Center community that will last for generations. Valley Center families are forever blessed with your kindness,\u201d said Laurie Gonzalez, Rincon Tribal Council Member.\nIn the coming months, Parks and Recreation will be reaching out to the community with invitations to public meetings, surveys and other events where you can learn more about the park project, suggest amenities and share feedback on proposed designs.
