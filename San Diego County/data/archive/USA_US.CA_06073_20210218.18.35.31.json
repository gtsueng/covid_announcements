The closure may be extended to Sunday and Monday depending on when more vaccine doses arrive.\nThose affected by appointment cancellations are being notified via their UCSD MyChart accounts and should also check their email.\nThe Sharp vaccination super station sites at Chula Vista Center and Grossmont Center are still offering first and second dose appointments with Pfizer vaccine.\nThe County\u2019s vaccination super station at the Del Mar Fairgrounds remains open and is honoring previously scheduled appointments.\nThe Centers For Disease Control and Prevention has advised that people can wait up to 42 days between doses and still achieve maximum immunity.
