While some local businesses will have blood pressure screenings on site, San Diegans are encouraged to only get their blood pressure checked if they are out conducting essential activities.\nAlso, and thanks to The San Diego Foundation, 6,000 low-income families in the region will receive blood pressure cuffs to monitor their blood pressure numbers.\n\u201cWe are proud to bring funders together to support the \u2018Love Your Heart\u2019 campaign, especially at a moment when health disparities have never been more apparent,\u201d said Mark Stuart, president and chief executive officer of The San Diego Foundation. \u201cThis announcement is part of a long-term effort to improve the quality of life for all San Diegans and to chip away at the health inequalities that have existed here in San Diego County for generations.\u201d\nHigh blood pressure is known as the \u201csilent killer\u201d because it may show no symptoms. However, hypertension puts people at an increased risk for heart disease and stroke, two of the top causes of death in the region. Fifty-nine percent of San Diegans have hypertension.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that you know your numbers and to make your heart health a priority,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cBeing proactive can save your life and help protect you from the worst COVID-19 outcomes if you do become infected, including an extended hospitalization in the intensive care unit.\u201d\nLast year, more than 56,000 people got their blood pressure checked at Love Your Heart sites in the United States and Mexico, which joined the campaign in 2015.\nA woman gets her blood pressure checked at the Mexican Consulate in Little Italy.\nLove Your Heart aligns with Live Well San Diego, the County\u2019s vision for healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities.\nSan Diegans who participate in Love Your Heart are encouraged to submit\u00a0their results and participate in online educational\u00a0workshops throughout February. People can submit their results\u00a0during the entire month of February to learn what they mean and receive a free face mask and hand sanitizer while supplies last.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210208.14.35.21"}
