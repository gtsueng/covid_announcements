The storm is expected to bring heavy rain and high winds.\nThe county already saw wet weather earlier this week and after the New Year\u2019s Eve storm, forecasters say more rain and wind may arrive in the middle of next week.\nTo forestall any potential flooding or soil erosion, people in the unincorporated areas can stop by at any one of several fire stations to fill sandbags or get bags. Call ahead of time to check their hours of operation and to see if supplies are still available. Be sure to bring your own shovel to fill your bags.\nLocations are listed below. Before you go, you may want to watch this how-to video on how to properly fill and use sandbags to protect your property.
