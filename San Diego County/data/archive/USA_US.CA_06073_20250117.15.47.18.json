For example, Day Use Parking will increase from $3.00 per day to $5.00 per day and an RV partial hook-up campsite will increase from $29 to $35. Revising the fees will also make things simpler by including up to two pets and one extra vehicle as part of your camping reservation.\nIn addition, Parks has programs to expand access to the outdoors and reduce financial barriers, including veteran, senior and group discounts as well as scholarships and the free First Time Camping Program. \nCounty Parks & Recreation services\u00a0enhance the quality of life for County residents and visitors. They promote health and wellness and safe communities through thousands of programs for all ages and abilities, including 158 facilities across more than 58,000 acres of land and 389 miles of trails.\nFor more information, please visit the Q&A on the Department of Parks & Recreation website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250117.15.47.18"}
