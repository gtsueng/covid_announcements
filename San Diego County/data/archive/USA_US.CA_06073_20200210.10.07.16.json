Wouldn\u2019t it be great if he or she jumped up and down when you got home? Forget Tinder. People aren\u2019t always truthful on those sites.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBut animals are loyal, faithful friends who always lend an ear whether you have great news to share or\u00a0 are feeling blue. A dog or cat could be the best Valentine\u2019s Day present to yourself ever.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe County Department of Animal Services will be holding a Valentine\u2019s dog and cat adoption special from Feb. 11 through Feb. 16 to help you find your new love monster. Any dog or cat, over the age of six months, can be yours for $14.\u00a0\n\u201cChocolates are quickly eaten and roses will eventually wilt, but an adopted animal\u2019s love for their new family will last a lifetime,\u201d County Animal Services Director Dan DeSousa said.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you\u2019d like to see all the animals, stop by the shelter or visit the\u202fadoptions page. If you absolutely fall in love with one, don\u2019t delay because adoptions are on a first-come, first-served basis. Be aware that each adoption could take up to two hours.\u00a0 To speed up the\u202fprocess, go online, download the\u202fadoption application\u202fand fill it out at home. Renters should also bring a copy of their lease to show it\u2019s OK to have a pet at their home.\u00a0\nWhen you find a pet you want to adopt, bring their ID number shown on the front of the kennel to the Greeter Desk.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you currently have another dog, you may consider bringing him or her with you to see how he or she interacts with a new dog. Families are also welcome and may get to spend time with the dog or cat to see if the adoption will be a good fit.\u00a0\nCurrently, more than 51 are available at the County\u2019s\u202ftwo\u202fanimal care facilities\u202flocated in Bonita and Carlsbad. All the adopted animals will be spayed or neutered, and microchipped before they go home. Vaccinations will also be up to date on dogs and cats.\u00a0\nShelter hours are 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., but adoptions close at 4 p.m. Normal adoption fees are: kittens under the age of 6 months, $75; cats, $65; puppies under the age of 6 months, $100; dogs, $75.\u00a0\nFor more information about County Animal Services, visit\u202fsddac.com\u202for call (619) 767-2675.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200210.10.07.16"}
