Each of those sectors includes a wide variety of occupations, and there are vaccination plans in place for certain subsets of those groups.\nThose not covered by specific vaccination plans for their occupation should contact their primary care doctor or schedule an appointment at vaccinationsuperstationsd.com.\nNewly-eligible essential workers\nEmergency services includes law enforcement officers, whose vaccination appointments will be coordinated by Scripps Health. Others in that sector include those working in 911 call centers, building security, disaster monitoring and hazardous materials response.\nEducation and childcare includes all teachers and staff at those facilities. Those working in transitional kindergarten through 12th grade will have appointments coordinated by the County Office of Education through the California Schools VEBA. They must use vebavaccinates.com and should not show up at vaccination sites prior to an appointment confirmed through VEBA\nEducation staff working at childcare facilities or in higher education not covered by California Schools VEBA should go through their primary care doctor or visit vaccinationsuperstationsd.com.\nFood and agriculture includes workers for any grocery or convenience store; those supporting restaurant carry-out and quick serve food operations, including food preparation; food manufacturing; a variety of support functions for food and animal feed industries.\nThe food and agriculture sector also includes farm workers.

Operation Collaboration will visit fields and agricultural areas to deliver vaccines to workers in remote areas of the county.\nThe newly eligible groups are in addition to health care workers and anyone 65 and older. People 16 years of age and older with underlying conditions, regardless of occupation, can begin signing up for vaccinations on March 15.\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 15 cases per 100,000 residents (as of Feb. 23) and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 5%, placing the County in Tier 2 or the Red Tier. While the testing positivity rate for the County qualifies it for the Red Tier, the state uses the most restrictive metric \u2013 in this case the adjusted case rate \u2013 and assigns counties to that tier. Therefore, the County remains in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 7.4% and is in the Red Tier or Tier 2.
