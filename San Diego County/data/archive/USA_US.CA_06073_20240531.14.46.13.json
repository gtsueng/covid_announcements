The goal is to reduce these pests and their risk for spreading diseases, such as West Nile virus.\nEvery year in spring, the County\u2019s Vector Control Program applies a safe, eco-friendly larvicide by helicopter to treat nearly 1,400 acres of hard-to-reach areas where mosquitoes breed. This year, locations in the Tijuana River Valley with stagnant water are also being treated to protect people living or visiting in that area.\nThe larvicide does not hurt people or pets, but kills mosquito larvae before they can grow into adult biting mosquitoes.\nLarvicide drops, during the mosquito season (usually April-October), are just one part of Vector Control\u2019s Integrated Vector Management Strategy. County Vector Control monitors over 1,600 potential mosquito-breeding areas each year and applies larvicide through a variety of techniques\u2014aerial drops, boats, trucks, and hand-crews. It also gives out free mosquito-eating fish to the public, tracks down and treats neglected swimming pools, tests dead birds for West Nile virus, and monitors mosquito populations for potential mosquito-borne illnesses.\n\u00a0You Can Make a Difference Too\nWant to protect yourself from mosquitoes? Follow our \u201cPrevent, Protect, Report\u201d guidelines.\nPrevent Mosquito Breeding\nDump out or remove any items inside and outside of homes that can hold water, such as plant saucers, rain gutters, buckets, garbage cans, toys, old tires, and wheelbarrows. Mosquito fish, available for free at locations throughout the county, may be used to control mosquito breeding in backyard standing water sources, such as unmaintained swimming pools, ponds, fountains, and horse troughs.\nProtect Yourself from Mosquito Bites\nProtect yourself from mosquito-borne illnesses by wearing long sleeves and pants or use insect repellent when outdoors. Use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Make sure screens on windows and doors are in good condition and secured to keep insects out.\nReport Increased Mosquito Activity and Dead Birds\nReport increased mosquito activity, or stagnant, unmaintained swimming pools, and other mosquito-breeding sources, as well as dead birds \u2014 dead crows, ravens, jays, hawks and owls \u2014 to the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality\u2019s Vector Control Program by calling (858) 694-2888 or emailing\u00a0vector@sdcounty.ca.gov.\u00a0\nIf you have checked around your home for standing water and are still experiencing mosquito issues, you can request an educational mosquito inspection by contacting the\u00a0Vector Control Program\u00a0at (858) 694-2888.\nFor more information about mosquito-borne illnesses go to San Diego County\u2019s\u00a0\u201cFight the Bite\u201d website. Here are some tips to help you keep your yard from becoming a mosquito breeding ground.\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240531.14.46.13"}
