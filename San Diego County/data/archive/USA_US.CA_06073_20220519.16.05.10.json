Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cCOVID-19 boosters for everyone who is eligible are easy to get because we have plenty of vaccine available in the region.\u201d\nMIS-C Cases in San Diego County\nWhile COVID-19 symptoms tend to be less severe in children, the Omicron variants have been making more San Diego children sick, with some requiring hospitalization and others developing multisystem inflammatory syndrome or MIS-C. From November 27, 2021 to May 7, 2022, 90% of the pediatric hospitalizations for the syndrome occurred in not fully vaccinated children.\nSince the pandemic began, there have been 98 MIS-C cases in San Diego County.\u00a0 Fifty-three percent of MIS-C cases have been reported in children ages 5 to 11 and the majority (60%) have been Hispanic.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cMIS-C is a rare, but serious, postinfectious hyperinflammatory condition occurring about 2 to 6 weeks after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\u201d\nSymptoms of MIS-C include fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash, inflammation and multiorgan dysfunction. In severe cases, children can experience hypotension (low blood pressure) and shock. Approximately 60-80% of the early cases of MIS-C patients required intensive care admission.\n\u201cMIS-C can often be so severe that children require life-saving interventions. Parents should contact their doctor immediately if their child develops any of these symptoms,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cThe best thing parents can do is get all the recommended doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children.\u201d\nVaccine supplies remain plentiful, both for those seeking initial doses and those eligible for boosters. People can get vaccinated or a booster through their medical provider, a retail pharmacy or a site operated by the County. Additional booster eligibility details are at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com.\nVaccination Progress:\n\nReceived at least one shot: Nearly 2.96 million or 94.0% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.\nFully vaccinated: Over 2.62 million or 83.3%.\nBoosters administered: 1,323,824 or 58.5% of 2,264,730 eligible San Diegans.\nMore vaccination information can be found at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.\n\nDeaths:\n\n11 additional deaths were reported since the last report on May 12.
