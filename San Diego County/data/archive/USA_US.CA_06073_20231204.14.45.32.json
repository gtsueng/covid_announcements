All registered voters fall under two categories:\n\nRegistered with a Political Party Preference\n\nIf you are registered with one of the six political parties in California, your ballot will list only that party\u2019s presidential primary candidates. You can vote only for that party\u2019s presidential candidates.\nCalifornia\u2019s political parties are:\n\nAmerican Independent Party\nDemocratic Party\nGreen Party\nLibertarian Party\nPeace and Freedom Party\nRepublican Party\n\nIf your party registration differs from the party of the presidential candidate you want to vote for, you will need to register to vote with that party. If you want to change your party registration, the Registrar\u2019s office advises you to do so before Feb. 20, 2024.\n\nRegistered as Nonpartisan (also known as independent or no party preference)\n\nIf you are registered as nonpartisan, you will automatically receive a nonpartisan ballot for the March 5 election. Your nonpartisan ballot will not list the presidential primary contest or candidates.\nThere are nearly 490,000 voters in San Diego County registered as nonpartisan. If you are one of them, you can take steps now to vote for a presidential candidate in the primary.\nAs a nonpartisan voter, you can select one of three different crossover ballot types.\nPolitical Parties Allowing Nonpartisan Voters to Crossover:\nThis year the American Independent Party, Democratic Party, and Libertarian Party are allowing nonpartisan voters to take part in their presidential primary elections.\nNonpartisan voters must request one of these three parties\u2019 ballots to vote for that party\u2019s presidential primary candidate. Selecting one of these three political party ballots will not register you with that party. You will remain a nonpartisan voter.\nIf you are a nonpartisan voter, you will soon get a postcard asking you to let the Registrar\u2019s office know your choice of a party crossover ballot before Jan. 5, so it is included in the first mailing of ballots going out the week of Feb. 4.\nYou may also complete the Registrar\u2019s nonpartisan crossover party ballot request form found at sdvote.com or visit the Registrar\u2019s office from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.\nPolitical Parties NOT Allowing Nonpartisan Voters to Crossover\nThis year, the Green Party, Peace and Freedom Party, and Republican Party have closed their presidential primary to nonpartisan voters.\nNonpartisan voters will not be able to select one of these ballots. Nonpartisan voters who want one of these parties\u2019 ballots will need to re-register with that party.\nThis can be done by completing a new voter registration online.\nNo matter what your party preference, all registered voters will be allowed to vote on nonpartisan contests and voter-nominated offices, such as U.S. congressional offices and state legislative offices.\nThe top two vote getters in voter-nominated contests will advance to the Nov. 5 general election.\nNot sure which political party you\u2019re registered with or if you\u2019re registered to vote? \nYou can check your registration, re-register, and register to vote at sdvote.com.\nThe Registrar\u2019s office encourages you to do so well before Feb. 20 to avoid delays and long lines at vote centers.\nLearn more about voting in the March 5 presidential primary at sdvote.com, or call (858) 565-5800 or toll free at (800) 696-0136.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231204.14.45.32"}
