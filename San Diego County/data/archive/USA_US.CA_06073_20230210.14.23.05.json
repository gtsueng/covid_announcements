The effort is part of the County\u2019s framework for ending homelessness through permanent housing and support targeted at the root cause and prevention.\n\u201cThis is a huge step forward to advocate for San Diegans in need of safe affordable housing,\u201d David Estrella, Director of County HCDS said. \u201cIt will allow us to reach our vulnerable neighbors and provide equitable housing opportunities.\u201d\nIn 2022, the County provided financial support for new affordable housing units that will serve 1,151 people, a group that includes seniors, families, veterans, and those experiencing homelessness.\nHCDS also received Board approval to apply for new and existing state funding through three state housing programs:\n\nPermanent Local Housing Allocation Program\nProhousing Incentive Pilot Program\nCalHome Program\n\nThe Permanent Local Housing Allocation Program increases the supply of low-income housing and housing to assist those at risk of or experiencing homelessness, while the Prohousing Incentive Pilot Program helps create and preserve affordable housing. The CalHome Program provides support for first-time homebuyers through down payment and closing cost assistance.\nThe Board also provided $3.3 million to help build Kettner Crossings. The $45 million development at the corner of Cedar Street and Kettner Boulevard will include 65 units for low-income seniors. It is being built on surplus County property and expected to break ground later this year.\nHCDS helps more than 35,500 people live in safe affordable housing. As part of that housing, the department maintains nearly 7,600 affordable units in 109 developments throughout the County. More than 16,700 people call those units home.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230210.14.23.05"}
