The magazine gave the facility the top ranking in the state in 2019 and 2020.\nThis year, the magazine analyzed nursing homes in 25 states with the highest population size and chose 450 winners.\nFor its list of\u00a0America\u2019s Best Nursing Homes 2022, the magazine looked at three critical criteria in creating its ranking: overall performance data, peer recommendations and each facility\u2019s handling of COVID-19.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise. At Edgemoor, we provide the highest level of care to seriously ill and injured adult patients who require long-term care, and it has not gone unnoticed,\u201d said Nick Macchione, director of the County Health and Human Services Agency.\n\nUnder the umbrella of County Behavioral Health Services, Edgemoor patients receive 24-hour skilled nursing care, physical rehabilitation, as well as recreational, occupational and speech therapy. Patients at the 192-bed facility require specialized interventions from highly trained staff.\n\u201cThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we\u2019ve taken every precaution to make our residents stay safe and healthy,\u201d said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services. \u201cNursing home residents are particularly vulnerable to this virus, and I\u2019m extremely proud of the work and commitment of both the Edgemoor staff and our guests to everyone\u2019s safety in these challenging times.\u201d\nThe commitment of the staff at Edgemoor embodies the County\u2019s approach to service and exemplifies the\u00a0Live Well San Diego\u00a0vision of healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities.\n\u201cThe doctors, nurses and everyone else working at Edgemoor make every effort to provide exceptional care for our patients,\u201d said Erin Chancler, Edgemoor\u2019s administrator. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-deserved recognition given everyone\u2019s commitment and dedication.\u201d\nThe latest Newsweek ranking adds to the national recognition Edgemoor has received for providing top-quality treatment and services. Edgemoor is a five-star facility, having received this highest rating from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for quality services.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211012.10.02.51"}
