There will be classes and workshops to learn about gardening, composting and other topics connected to sustainability and nutrition.\nFletcher and Vargas said home and neighborhood gardens provide a multitude of benefits, from improving the food system and addressing food insecurity, to cultivating better nutrition, creating a sense of community and promoting healthy living.\n\u201cWe can empower communities through food,\u201d Fletcher said, \u201cand bring them together with accessible community gardens. When we can gather together to grow our own food, it is not only a rewarding activity but also has tremendous economic and environmental benefits. I see gardens as an opportunity to build a stronger safety net for all San Diegans and create a more inclusive and resilient food and farm economy.\u201d\nVargas said gardens can create a sense of community and promote social engagement among families and neighbors, in addition to giving people the opportunity to get outside, live active lifestyles and connect with nature.\n\u201cThe power of community gardens, the way they help build our communities\u2019 resilience and improve not only physical and mental health outcomes, especially in food insecure communities, it really is powerful,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cIt is my hope that this demonstration garden \u2026 will inspire others to plant their own gardens in their neighborhoods.\u201d\nThe garden features four raised planting beds, including one that is accessible to people in wheelchairs, a demonstration rain barrel and compost-worm bin, and will eventually be watered by a drip irrigation system. It will also include a container garden, a flowering \u201cpollinator\u201d bed to attract bees, butterflies and ladybugs, and will use the County Operations Center\u2019s existing composting system to recharge the garden\u2019s soil.\nThere will be signs in multiple languages with information about gardening and nutrition, resources to healthy food, and even a Little Free Library outside the garden\u2019s gate.\nYou can learn more about the garden and its future events at the Demonstration Garden\u2019s webpage.
