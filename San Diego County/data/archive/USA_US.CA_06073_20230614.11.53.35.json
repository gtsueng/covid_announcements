The state could approve the funding in its final budget deliberations.\nCounty health officials said Tuesday that the agency has and continues to create ongoing suicide prevention programs and efforts, and that local suicide rates have trended down. However, they said the county\u2019s rates are still higher than state averages and that suicide remained an urgent, growing problem that needs addressing. Officials said the numbers of suicides between the ages of 15 and 19 increased 29% between 2017 and 2021, and that suicide remains a leading cause of death for San Diegans.\nPrograms the County has developed that could be used as bases in the pilot program include the \u201cIt\u2019s Up to Us\u201d multi-media campaign. The program aims to increase public awareness and understanding of suicide and the issues surrounding it. The County\u2019s Mobile Crisis Response Teams send mental health experts to respond to people suffering a mental health crisis where they are to connect them to care. In addition, the County\u2019s 24/7 Access and Crisis line \u2014 (888) 724-7240 \u2014 gives people a way to talk directly with a clinician to help them around the clock. That help was supplemented last year with the local introduction of the national 988\u00a0National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a national network of local crisis centers that provides free and confidential emotional support to people in a suicidal, mental health and/or substance use crisis, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nAnother County effort includes the San Diego County Suicide Prevention Council, which, among other efforts, coordinates mental health trainings and takes the lead in producing the annual Report to the Community that reports on suicide resources and data.\nMore information about the County\u2019s behavioral health services can be found at its website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230614.11.53.35"}
