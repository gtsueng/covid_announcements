The deceased was a 10-year-old boy with underlying medical conditions.\n\u201cOur deepest condolences go out to the family and friends of this child,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThis boy\u2019s death is a somber reminder that this pandemic impacts everyone in our community, regardless of their age, and we must do everything we can to protect each other and slow the spread of the virus.\u201d\nWooten continues to urge San Diegans to do the following:\n\nWash your hands\nWatch your distance around others\nWear a mask\nWhen sick, stay home and get tested\nGet vaccinated when it is your turn\n\nSouth Bay Vaccination Clinic Moves\nThis coming Tuesday, Feb. 9, the County\u2019s Imperial Beach walk-thru vaccination clinic is moving from its current location at Imperial Beach City Hall to the gym at Mar Vista High School, located at 505 Elm Avenue.
