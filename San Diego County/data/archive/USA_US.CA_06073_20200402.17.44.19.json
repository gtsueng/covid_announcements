Businesses, including grocery stores, convenience stores and restaurants, are required to have employees wear face coverings.\nThe new order and guidance will go into effect at midnight, Friday, April 3.\n\u201cWe have to take more aggressive measures during the coming weeks to keep people from contracting COVID-19 and to continue flatting the pandemic curve,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cWe all have an essential role to play and must take these actions to slow and prevent the spread of COVID-19.\u201d\nThe County is implementing these new guidelines to keep COVID-19 from making more people sick. They include:\n\nResidents are strongly encouraged to cover their nose and mouth when leaving home for essential activities, such as grocery shopping, getting gas, visiting convenience stores or pharmacies.\nThe cloth facial coverings don\u2019t have to be hospital grade but should cover the nose and mouth. Homemade masks, bandanas, scarves and neck gaiters are acceptable since these items can be washed and reused. Facial coverings don\u2019t need to be used when people are at home.\nEffective, Saturday, April 4, all employees of essential businesses must wear a facial covering at supermarkets, grocery stores, gas stations, convenience stores, restaurants and pharmacies.\nAll public parks and beaches shall close their parking lots.\nLaw enforcement agencies throughout the region will be out making sure that people who are in public are conducting essential activities and to keep people from being out in groups, especially if they are not members of the same family or household.\nPeople who disobey the essential business guideline or who are in groups in public are subject to a misdemeanor ticket. Penalties can be up to a $1,000 fine or 6 months in jail.\n\n\u201cPeople should continue to practice physical distancing even when wearing facial coverings,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cThey should also wash their hands and take other preventive measures since they can still contract the virus if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nWe're live at the County Operations Center with another update on the coronavirus.
