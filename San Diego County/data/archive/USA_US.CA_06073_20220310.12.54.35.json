Election workers can earn up to $20 an hour depending on the position.\nThere is a particular need for election workers to manage the operations of ballot drop box locations and site managers for vote centers around the county.\nBallot drop box locations will be open for nearly a month and vote centers will be open for up to 11 days instead of one. The Registrar\u2019s office will hire election workers rather than use volunteer poll workers because training is more extensive for the expanded time period.\nThe Registrar is seeking people who are team players, exhibit strong leadership and customer service skills and display flexibility, patience, and the highest level of integrity at all times. Election workers must represent the Registrar of Voters in a professional, nonpartisan manner.\nEnglish speakers who are bilingual in Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese or Chinese are also needed. If you are fluent in one of these languages, be sure to indicate it on your application.\nThe Registrar\u2019s office is working with Public Health Services to ensure the health and safety of election workers and voters. Recommended personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies will be provided to workers so they can conduct the election process safely.\nApplications are available online. For more information, call (858) 565-5800 or email pollworker@sdcounty.ca.gov.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220310.12.54.35"}
