And you can shop close to home to prevent carbon emissions created by driving all over the county.\nSustainability is very important to us, and we know it is to you too.\nSo, here\u2019s a longer list of ideas to have a happy, giving, sustainable holiday season.\nGifts\nGive Experiences Instead of Things:\u00a0One thing you can do to cut down on the accumulation of stuff we give and get that we may never use is to give gifts of \u201cexperiences\u201d rather than items that will eventually be tossed out. For example, give someone tickets to a show, free lessons in something they\u2019d enjoy, or a gift card to a local restaurant! For a list of experiences, you can go to WasteFreeSD\u2019s \u201cresources\u201d page, do a word search for \u201cexperiences\u201d and click on their \u201cGift Ideas\u2014Experiences Instead of Things\u201d webpage.\nDonations:\u00a0Another thing you can give, or receive, instead of more physical stuff is to ask family and friends to donate to something you\u2019re into. Like an animal rescue or a pet cause! Many animal organizations allow you to \u201csponsor\u201d or \u201cadopt\u201d an animal virtually to rescue it and ensure it is loved and cared for.\nLike the Kitchen? Bake a Gift!\u00a0Everyone loves food at the holidays. And you don\u2019t need to be a world-renowned chef to put a smile on someone\u2019s face. You know, banana bread is\u00a0really\u00a0easy to make. Cookies, cakes, quick breads\u2014you can do it!\nGreen Thumbs?\u00a0If you have any friends or family who like to garden or grow their own herbs, you can re-use portions of the empty cardboard tubes from paper towels to create planting \u201cpots\u201d for seedlings!\nShopping\nShop Local:\u00a0Shopping locally, especially at businesses that feature sustainable and handcrafted gifts, can cut back on a lot of the carbon emissions that your car will put into the atmosphere by driving all over the county\u2014or by having items shipped from faraway places.\nShop Online, Give Yourself Time:\u00a0If you do find yourself shopping online to have gifts shipped, plan ahead and order early so items can be shipped by ground\u2014truck, trains and ships\u2014rather than having to be rush-shipped by air, which leaves a much larger carbon footprint.\nLook for Gifts Without a Lot of Packaging:\u00a0Items like candles, soaps, coffee mugs, water bottles, cooking utensils, oils and sauces attractive enough to be given with just a homemade bow or come in containers that can be reused again and again.\nGive Gift Certificates to Zero Waste stores:\u00a0There\u2019s a movement in retail to create \u201czero-waste\u201d stores\u2014retailers that sell mostly in bulk or using compostable packaging, to customers carrying their own reusable containers.\nWrapping\nDitch the Fancy Wrapping Paper:\u00a0There are a lot of ways you can wrap holiday gifts without getting the fancy paper wrapping.\u00a0In fact, a lot of fancy paper wrapping can\u2019t be recycled.\u00a0Here are some alternatives. If you\u2019re into crafts, you can sew your own bags to wrap gifts in, then reuse them every year! Not into sewing? You can use fabric scraps to wrap gifts. And remember to reuse ribbons and bags again in the future.\nAnother option is to use holiday decorative kitchen towels:\u00a0Tie them up with a ribbon. They\u2019re reusable and who doesn\u2019t want a new kitchen towel?\nRecycled Wrapping Paper:\u00a0If you do use wrapping paper, choose wrapping paper that is made from recycled materials and can be recycled again.\nHoliday Cards\nGo Digital:\u00a0Instead of buying and sending paper cards, send ecards, or post on social media like Instagram and Facebook to send holiday greetings to friends and family.\nFood and Gatherings\nInviting Friends Over for Food?\u00a0Plan ahead, shop smart and serve just enough to make everyone happy\u00a0without wasting food. Of course, figuring out how much food to make can be difficult. However,\u00a0SaveTheFood.com\u00a0has a \u201cGuest-imator\u201d that can help you calculate just how much food you need to prepare, based on how many people you\u2019re serving and how much they typically eat, even during holiday feasts.\nInvite Your Guests to BOYRFCs (Bring Your Own Reusable Food Container):\u00a0Yeah, that abbreviation is unlikely to catch on. However, asking guests bring their own reusable \u201cto go\u201d containers is an idea that\u00a0should\u00a0catch on. That way if there are leftovers, it\u2019s easy as pie for your guests to bring some home! No waste and no one-time-only food containers.\nRemember to Compost:\u00a0And don\u2019t forget to compost leftovers if you do have them. If you don\u2019t have your own compost pile or bin, you can place any remaining food scraps and organic waste into your curbside green bin!\u00a0(Note: If you have your own compost bin at home, don\u2019t compost meats and bones; they can attract pests.)\nThe Tree!\nOrnaments:\u00a0A lot of us are familiar with stringing popcorn and cranberry garlands to hang on the Christmas tree, but there are other alternatives as well. For example, you can cut slices of oranges, let them dry out and hang them from your tree!\nCraft Ornaments:\u00a0You can also make your own craft ornaments from paper, pinecones, seashells and other items.\nRecycle the tree and wreaths:\u00a0If you\u2019re using a real tree and natural wreaths, remember to recycle them instead of tossing them out where they can end up in landfills to decompose and generate climate-changing methane.\nRecycled trees and wreaths can be turned into mulch to improve soils at parks, farms, home gardens and landscapes. Check with your waste hauler to find out if they offer curbside pickup. Or go to the County\u2019s recycling and hazardous waste database,\u00a0WastefreeSD.org,\u00a0to find Christmas tree drop-off sites near you. It\u2019s easy.\nSo, remember, sustainability is a gift for the earth, your children and their children. And have a happy sustainable holiday season!\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241205.17.02.51"}
