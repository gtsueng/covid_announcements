Area residents voted and chose the building\u2019s design and color scheme.\nOutreach events, online surveys and public meetings shaped the exterior and interior details including all of the artistic d\u00e9cor. Additionally, six million dollars was earmarked for jobs to be filled by local applicants through subcontracting opportunities and workforce positions, with at least 5% of the workforce living in four area ZIP codes. Multiple workshops were held to connect work-ready individuals to construction jobs with onsite training. This new inclusive approach to a community project became a life-changing opportunity for local resident, Lloyd Ward.\nJoin us for a Southeastern Live Well Center community celebration Saturday, Oct. 14.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230711.14.08.58"}
