It has been a successful and inspiring first year.\nThrough the combined efforts of the County\u2019s Behavioral Health Services and Public Defender departments, Superior Court and other partners, there are currently 64 CARE Agreements. CARE Court has also celebrated 2 graduations.\u00a0\nThe CARE Act gives individuals an active role in creating their own CARE agreement for mental health treatment and housing support. Eligible adults are persons with untreated schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders.\nFamilies, clinicians, first responders, and others can file a petition with the civil court to connect people, 18 years and older, to court-ordered voluntary treatment if they meet criteria related to health and safety.\nThe CARE Act process relies on collaboration and promotes a voluntary, person-centered process. The County implemented the CARE Act on October 1, 2023, and by August 7, was celebrating it\u2019s first CARE Court graduation.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241001.19.18.33"}
