We need everyone\u2019s support so that we can prevent the region from moving into the most restrictive level,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cPeople should stay home as much as possible, telework if they can and avoid gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\u201d\nThe County\u2019s COVID-19 unadjusted case rate for the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10 increased from 7.2 to 7.8.\u00a0 The adjusted metric also rose from 6.8 to 7.0 cases per 100,000 people during the same time.\nShould the region post Purple Tier numbers for two weeks in a row, the County would be forced to follow the more restrictive state guidance.\n\u201cWe must bring our numbers down and the only way to do that is to limit our contact with people outside our households,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cSan Diegans who need to be out in public should wear a mask and maintain their distance from people outside their household. Avoid large crowds or gatherings to prevent getting or passing the virus.\u201d\nGiven the data reported for the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10, the County is expected to still be in the Red Tier when the state announces the region new standing Oct. 20.\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 6.8 per 100,000 residents. Limit for Tier 2 is 7.0.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 3.0%, placing it in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier.\nThe state\u2019s health equity metric looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions.\nThe County\u2019s health equity testing positivity percentage is 5.7. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance.\nThe California Department of Public Health will assess counties on a weekly basis, with the next report scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 20.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nOne new community outbreak was confirmed on Oct. 15 in a restaurant/bar setting.\nIn the past seven days (Oct. 9 through Oct. 16), 40 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n6,724 tests were reported to the County on Oct. 15, and the percentage of new laboratory-confirmed cases was 5%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 3.0%.\u00a0Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 9,085.\nPeople with and without symptoms who are at higher risk for COVID-19 should be tested. Health care and essential workers should also get a test, as well as people who had close contact to a positive case or live in communities that are being highly impacted.\n\nCases:\n\n311 new cases were confirmed among San Diego County residents on Oct. 15. The region\u2019s total is now 51,781.\n3,740 or 7.2% of all cases have required hospitalization.\n865 or 1.7% of all cases and 23.1% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nThree new COVID-19 deaths were reported in San Diego County on Oct. 15.
