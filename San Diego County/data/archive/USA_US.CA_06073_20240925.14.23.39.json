The meeting will take place at 5 p.m. on Oct. 2.\nEvery year, the County Office of Economic Development and Government Affairs (EDGA) identifies a legislative strategy for the Board of Supervisors.

The County also sponsored four state bills that addressed issues ranging from fentanyl education and overdose prevention to wildfire resilience and health care access. Two of the bills were signed into law and the other two are waiting for the signature.\nCommunity input is an important aspect of the County\u2019s legislative strategy.
