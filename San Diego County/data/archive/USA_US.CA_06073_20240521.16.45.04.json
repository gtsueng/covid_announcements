The money will go directly to participants\u2019 landlords.\u00a0\nApplications can be submitted starting tomorrow, May 22. The participants will be selected at random. Those selected will join 222 households previously chosen for the original pilot program in early 2023, which was subsequently approved for expansion by the County Board of Supervisors.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are grateful the County Board of Supervisors prioritized our seniors and allocated additional funds to ease the burden of our county\u2019s older adults and grandparents,\u201d said Barbara Jim\u00e9nez, Community Operations Officer for the County\u2019s Health and Human Services Agency. \u201cThis is an important part of the puzzle to prevent vulnerable populations from falling into homelessness.\u201d\u00a0\nThe County\u2019s Aging Roadmap forecasts that San Diego\u2019s 60 years or older population will grow to more than 910,000 people by 2030. The population 55 and older is expected to surpass 1.1 million.\u00a0\nAccording to the 2023 We All Count Point-in-Time Count, people over the age of 55 make up 29 percent of the region\u2019s unsheltered population.\u00a0\nTo apply for the Shallow Rental Subsidy Program, you must:\u00a0\n\nBe a San Diego resident 55 years or older at risk of homelessness.\u00a0\nHave a household income at or below 50% of the Area Median Income.\u00a0\nBe severely rent burdened, paying more than 50% of your income toward housing costs.\u00a0\nHave a lease or rental agreement in your name and a landlord willing to participate in the program.\u00a0\nNot be receiving funds from another rental subsidy program.\u00a0\nSign consent forms to participate in the program and an evaluation.\u00a0\n\nPeople who have questions about the program should email their full name and contact information to AHHSseniorprogram@equitablesolutions.com or call (619) 780-3684.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240521.16.45.04"}
