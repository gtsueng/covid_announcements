While veterans are eligible for housing vouchers, the housing itself can be hard to find. Right now, San Diego has about over 100 veterans holding vouchers in search of housing.\nAn important part of the \u201cLeave No Veteran Homeless\u201d initiative is recruiting landlords who are willing to step-up and offer some of their vacant units to these veterans holding vouchers. Landlords have the power to change the life of a service member who dedicated their life to this country. You can learn more about getting involved, and landlord incentives, at NoVeteranHomeless.org\nFor Eddie Walker, renting to veterans was one of his easiest decisions, and one of the most rewarding.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231108.09.09.23"}
