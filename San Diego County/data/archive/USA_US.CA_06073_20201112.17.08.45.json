The collaborative effort between the County of San Diego and the San Diego County Futures Foundation is especially important this year, as many children are distance learning due to COVID-19.\nStarted in 2001 by San Diego County Supervisor Greg Cox, the Computers for Foster Families Program aims to improve the lives of foster children and their families through the gift of technology. The initiative supports foster families by increasing computer and internet access for some of the region\u2019s most vulnerable children.\nThe computers, which were formerly used by County employees, are refurbished by the San Diego County Futures Foundation before they are distributed to foster families.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20201112.17.08.45"}
