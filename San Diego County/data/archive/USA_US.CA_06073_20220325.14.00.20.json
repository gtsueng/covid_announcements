The County is looking for submissions from visual and multimedia artists and will commission artwork for numerous spaces in and around the new center.\nOnce the artist proposals are received, the Southeastern San Diego Live Well Center Public Art Advisory Committee will be instrumental in advising on artist selection for the commissioned artwork. The Advisory Committee includes community residents and leaders from local grassroot organizations \u2013 with members representing various social, ethnic and cultural backgrounds in Southeastern San Diego.\nThe selected art will be placed in the outdoor main entry plaza, meditation garden, corridors, waiting and conference rooms, and family play area of the 65,000-square-foot center.\nArt at the Southeastern Live Well Center will represent and celebrate the history, diversity and cross-cultural experiences of the community while educating, creating beauty, inspiration and healing.\n\u201cLike many others, I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing the art that results from the proposals,\u201d said Barbara Jim\u00e9nez, the County\u2019s community operations officer who has been involved with this project for more than a decade. \u201cThis is an especially exciting part of the County\u2019s commitment to community engagement for our newest Live Well Center.\u201d\nThe County broke ground on the project at the corner of Market Street and Euclid Avenue in October of 2021. Construction is on schedule to be completed by next summer.\nOnce completed, the Southeastern Live Well Center will serve the community with a variety of services, including medical insurance coverage, food and nutrition assistance, family strengthening services, financial and employment assistance, public health, behavioral health, child support, restorative justice, services for older adults and people with disabilities, and military and veterans\u2019 services. A short walk from a trolley station, the Center will feature shared space for community meetings.\nArtist proposals are due at 11:59 p.m. on April 25 and should reflect the County\u2019s commitment to a healthy, safe and thriving region.
