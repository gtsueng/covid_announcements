A representative from County Supervisor Joel Anderson also attended.\nAfterward, park rangers took some attendees for a short hike on the newly named trail.\nNow in his mid-nineties, Degenfelder and his late wife founded the Ramona Trails Association in the 1980s.\nAnd that is just one of his many accomplishments. He founded and rode with the Mounted Patrol in Ramona. He created the Ramona Community Foundation which recently won Non-Profit of the Year.\nDegenfelder served on and chaired the Ramona Community Planning Group, and he helped the \u201cWelcome to Ramona\u201d sign become a reality.\nHe worked with former County Supervisor Dianne Jacob on the Santa Maria Creek Staging Area that was dedicated in June 2014. He still holds monthly meetings on future trail projects like the Santa Maria Creek Greenway. Degenfelder has also led multiple creek cleanup efforts.\nAnd there\u2019s more. He was a founding member of the Ramona United Methodist Church and just recently, Degenfelder turned over his many duties as Ramona\u2019s honorary mayor to a successor. The nonagenarian had served in that position for the last six years.\nThe Degenfelder Trail was formerly the Luelf Pond Trail. It is open to hikers, cyclists and equestrians with parking at Holly Oaks County Park. The one-mile-long shaded trail features towering coast live oaks and beautiful views.\nThe path is one of nearly two miles of trails on the 90-acre preserve.
