Gavin Newsom was in San Diego today to tour the County\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccination Super Station at Petco Park. The site was the first of its kind in the state and the governor lauded the County and its partners for their efforts in vaccinating more than 100,000 San Diegans at the site since it opened last month.\nThe governor said the Vaccination Super Station at Petco Park helped inspire jurisdictions across the state to initiate similar large-scale vaccination efforts.\nLocally, the County has added three additional Vaccination Super Stations and more than a dozen vaccine PODS since Petco Park became operational as a vaccination site. Together, medical professionals at these sites have administered about a half million COVID-19 vaccines to San Diegans eligible to be vaccinated.\nThe operation in the Tailgate Lot at Petco Park is the result of a partnership between the County, UC San Diego Health, the San Diego Padres and the\u00a0City of San Diego which owns the property. Speakers from all entities attended a press conference this morning to join the governor in talking about the region\u2019s vaccination efforts.\nSpeakers included Gov.
