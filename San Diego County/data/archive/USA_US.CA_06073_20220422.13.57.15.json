In addition to the deaths, more than 3 million cases of child abuse are reported in the U.S. each year.\nThe annual flag raising event at the Polinsky Children\u2019s Center coincides with Children\u2019s Memorial Day, which is part of National Child Abuse Prevention Month. The event is intended to provide the community with tools that help recognize the warning signs of abuse and neglect.\n\u201cChild abuse prevention starts with each one of us,\u201d said Kimberly Giardina, Child Welfare Services director. \u201cI encourage everyone in our community to educate themselves about the signs of child abuse, so we can collectively work towards preventing tragedies involving children.\u201d\nPolinsky Children\u2019s Center provides temporary emergency shelter to children who must be separated from their families for their own safety. Partners at Friday\u2019s ceremony included representatives from the County\u2019s Behavioral Health Services, the San Diego County Office of Education, the San Diego Juvenile Court, Probation, Rady Children\u2019s Hospital, Promises 2 Kids, and the YMCA.\nThe County Administration Center will be lit in blue Saturday in honor of National Child Abuse Prevention Month.\nIf you have reason to believe a child you know is experiencing abuse or neglect, contact the County\u2019s Child Abuse Hotline at 858-560-2191 or 800-344-6000. You can also call 2-1-1 San Diego, or check this website for a variety of resources related to child abuse prevention.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220422.13.57.15"}
