In addition, management at Super China Buffet has been contacted to identify and follow up with staff who may have been exposed. County staff will determine if individuals at the above locations have been vaccinated and their potential for developing measles.\n\u201cMeasles is a very contagious disease that can be spread easily by coughing, sneezing, or being in the same room with an infected person,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cAnyone who was at any of the specific locations and at the dates and times listed above should watch for symptoms and call their health care provider if they show any signs of the disease.\u201d\nPeople with symptoms are asked to call their doctor\u2019s office in advance, rather than visit an office directly, so that infection control measures may be activated to prevent exposure to others.\nMeasles develops seven to 21 days after exposure. Early symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. The distinctive red rash usually appears one to four days after early symptoms appear. A person is considered contagious four days before and four days after the rash appears. The rash typically begins on the face and head, then proceeds downward and outward to the hands and feet. It fades in the same order it began, from head to feet.\n\u201cThe best way to prevent measles is by getting the measles vaccine,\u201d said Wooten. \u201cWith measles outbreaks occurring in several countries, it is very important that all international travelers get vaccinated. Infants between 6 and 12 months of age who travel should get one dose, and travelers over 12 months of age should get two doses at least four weeks apart.\u201d\nComplications from measles are more common in children younger than 5 years old and adults 20 years and older. Complications can include diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia. Death can occur from severe complications and the risk is higher among younger children and adults. There is no treatment for measles. Bed rest, fluids, and fever control are recommended. People with complications may need treatment for their specific problems.\nFor more information about measles, other vaccine-preventable diseases and the shots that protect against them, please call the HHSA Immunization Branch at (866) 358-2966 or visit the website at\u00a0www.sdiz.org.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240202.17.34.14"}
