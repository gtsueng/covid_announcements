Some small tricks can help you enjoy treats in a healthy way.\u00a0\nCounty of San Diego Chief Dental Officer, Dr. Fadra Whyte, DMD, MPH shares some tips backed by the American Dental Association:\u00a0\n\nDon\u2019t eat all the candy \u2013 pick out your favorites and donate the rest.\u00a0\nChocolate is better for your teeth than other hard or sticky candies. Dark chocolate has less sugar than milk chocolate and doesn\u2019t stick to your teeth like caramels or gummies.\u00a0\nEat your candy with a meal. The food and saliva in your mouth help rinse away little bits of candy and bacteria that cause cavities.\nChew sugarless gum for 20 minutes after eating a piece of candy to help clean your teeth.\u00a0\nMost importantly, brush your teeth after eating candy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHappy Halloween!\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231030.14.05.22"}
