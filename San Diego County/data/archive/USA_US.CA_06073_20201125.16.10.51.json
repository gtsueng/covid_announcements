The financial relief will help them to reverse some of the disproportional impact on their operations and keep some from having to close permanently.\nThe County\u2019s five supervisorial district offices will review and recommend applicants for $4 million in funds each. Applications are available at the Small Business Stimulus Grant Program website. Award recipients will also be posted on the site.\nBusinesses that submitted a previous application do not need to reapply.\nThis is the fourth time the Board has voted to provide stimulus grant funds for restaurants and other small businesses. In past months, the Board approved a total of $27.5 million in\u00a0Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security or CARES Act funds.\nCOVID-19 Testing on Thanksgiving Holiday\nThe County will continue to operate free, COVID-19 testing sites throughout the holiday weekend.\nNov. 26:\nThree no-appointment sites will be open from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day:\n\nCal State University San Marcos, 333 S.

The state uses the more restrictive measure of case rate or testing positivity to assign tiers regarding what activities are permitted. Indoor operations at\u00a0restaurants, gyms, places of worship and movie theaters\u00a0are currently not allowed.\nThe County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 13.1 cases per 100,000 residents and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1 for that metric.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 3.1%, placing it in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier for that metric.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 9.3% and it\u2019s in the Purple Tier or Tier 1. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance to a less restrictive tier.\nThe California Department of Public Health announced that tier assignments, typically given each Tuesday, may now occur any day of the week and may occur more than once a week.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\n10 new community outbreaks were confirmed on Nov. 24: four in business settings, two in restaurant/bar settings, one in a government setting, one in a distribution warehouse setting, one in a retail setting and one in a higher education setting.\nIn the past seven days (Nov. 18 through Nov. 24), 76 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n20,738 tests were reported to the County on Nov. 24, and the percentage of new laboratory-confirmed cases was 5%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 5.3%. Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 21,316.\nPeople with and without symptoms who are at higher risk for COVID-19 should be tested. Healthcare and essential workers should also get a test, as well as people who have had close contact to a positive case or live in communities that are being highly impacted.\n\nCases:\n\n944 new cases were confirmed among San Diego County residents on Nov. 24, the second highest one-day total. The region\u2019s total is now 75,305.\n4,470 or 5.9% of all cases have required hospitalization.\n1,006 or 1.3% of all cases and 22.5% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\nA new\u00a0COVID-19 case rate mapshows how local cities and communities are being impacted by the virus.\n\nDeaths:\n\nFour new deaths were reported in the County on Nov. 24. The region\u2019s total is now 988.\nFour men died between Nov. 14 and Nov. 22, and their ages ranged from late 50s to mid-80s.\nAll had underlying medical conditions.\n\nMore Information:\nThe more detailed data summaries found on the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0are updated around 5 p.m. daily.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20201125.16.10.51"}
