The state uses the more restrictive measure of case rate or testing positivity to assign tiers regarding what activities are permitted. Indoor operations at\u00a0restaurants, gyms, places of worship and movie theaters\u00a0are currently not allowed.\nThe County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 15.6 cases per 100,000 residents and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1 for that metric.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 4.7%, placing it in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier for that metric.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 9.3% and it\u2019s in the Purple Tier or Tier 1. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance to a less restrictive tier.\nThe California Department of Public Health announces tier assignments at least once a week.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nSeven new community outbreaks were confirmed on Nov. 29: three in business settings, one in a restaurant setting, one in a faith-based setting, one in a healthcare setting and one in a grocery setting.\nNine community outbreaks were confirmed Nov. 28: four in business settings, one in restaurant setting, one in a retail setting one in a daycare/preschool/childcare setting, one in a government setting and one in an emergency services setting.\n16 community outbreaks were confirmed Nov. 27: five in business settings, three in restaurant/bar settings, three in retail settings, one in a restaurant setting, one in a grocery setting, one in a faith-based setting, one in a daycare/preschool/childcare setting and one in a healthcare setting.\n10 community outbreaks were confirmed Nov. 26: two in restaurant/bar settings, two in business settings, two in retail settings, two in restaurant settings, one in a grocery setting and one in a daycare/preschool/childcare setting.\n12 community outbreaks were reported Nov. 26: three in business settings, two in restaurant/bar settings, one in government setting, one in a grocery setting, one in a retail setting, one in a food/beverage processing setting, one in a construction setting, one in a faith-based setting and one in an other setting.\nIn the past seven days (Nov. 22 through Nov. 28), 79 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n15,348 tests were reported to the County on Nov. 29, and the percentage of new laboratory-confirmed cases was 6%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 6.1%.
