Hotels and other lodging can open.\nThe changes are a result of California health officials\u2019 announcement today that the Regional Stay Home Order has been lifted for all regions of the state.\nThe state\u2019s four-week intensive care unit bed availability projection for the Southern California region, which includes San Diego County, is expected to be above 15%, the threshold that allows regions to exit the order.\n\u201cWe urged San Diegans to stay at home and most heeded our message,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cTheir actions have helped to slow the spread of COVID-19, kept hospitals and health care workers from being completely overwhelmed and, most importantly, saved lives.\u201d\nThe lifting of the Regional Stay Home Order means that San Diego County is now back in Tier 1, or the Purple Tier, and can return to the rules and framework of the Blueprint for a Safer Economy, the color-coded tiers that indicate which activities and businesses are open based on local case rates and test positivity percentage.\nThe County\u2019s adjusted case rate is currently at 49.6 per every 100,000 residents, which is expected to be reflected on the state\u2019s website tomorrow. The rate is well above the 7.0 case rate that is required to move into the less restrictive Tier 2, or Red Tier. Fifty-four of the 58 California counties are in the strictest level, or Purple Tier.\nThe region\u2019s 7-day case positivity rate is 14.8%, also well above the 7% needed to move to the Red Tier.\nCounties must remain in their current tier for three weeks and post case rates and testing positivity percentage in the higher tier for two weeks before moving into the less restrictive level.\nTier updates are provided weekly on Tuesdays; however, counties can choose to impose stricter rules.\nHousehold gatherings are also now allowed, but they should be limited to no more than three households and the interactions must occur outdoors. People must also keep their distance and wear a mask. The 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew remains in effect.\n\u201cThe pandemic is not over, people should continue taking the recommended precautions,\u201d Wooten said.\nCounty health officials continue to urge San Diegans to do the following:\n\nWhen it\u2019s your turn, get vaccinated\nWash your hands\nWatch your distance around others\nWear a mask\nWhen sick, stay home and get tested\n\nPetco Park Vaccination Site Closed Until Tuesday Afternoon\nDue to bad weather, the Vaccination Super Station at Petco Park closed all day Monday and will remain closed Tuesday through at least 1 p.m. A full determination of scheduling for the day will be made Tuesday.\nAll Petco Park appointments scheduled for the closed hours are being moved by UC San Diego Health to later in the week. You should check your MyChart for your new scheduled time and bring proof of appointment and the right document when it is your turn.\nThe vaccination clinic at Petco Park is expected to reopen Tuesday afternoon.\nAppointments for Petco Park are honored only at that site. All other vaccination sites remain open.\nThe County is now vaccinating people 65 and older at its vaccination sites.
