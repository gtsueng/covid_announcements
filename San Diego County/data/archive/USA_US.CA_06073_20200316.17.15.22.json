Non-essential gatherings of any size are strongly discouraged.\nAll bars and adult entertainment establishments that serve alcohol and no food must close.\nAll restaurants or businesses that serve food must close on-site dining. Food delivery, pick-up or drive-through needs to be done using social distancing or keeping people six feet apart.\nAll schools of all grades to close; students who are minors must stay at home and not participate in activities prohibited by the order.\nAll people 65 or older, or anyone who has a chronic underlying condition or are immunocompromised should stay home.\nNon-essential personnel must stay away from hospitals or long-term care facility.\nAll businesses need to enact social distancing, increase cleaning standards and have employees work from home, if possible. Businesses must suspend doctor verification for sick or other leave approval.\nHospitals must preserve resources and delay non-emergency surgeries and elective procedures.\n\n\u201cWe are taking these measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep our health care system from being overwhelmed,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThere is now community spread of COVID-19 and the public needs to heed these measures to avoid contracting the virus.\u201d\nThe County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) is aggressively working to do contact tracing of all the patients who have tested positive for COVID-19. The appropriate people will be placed under self-quarantine and monitored for possible symptoms of COVID-19.\nAll people returning from the list of impacted countries \u2014South Korea, Japan, Italy, China and Iran, and others added to the list \u2014 need to follow a 14-day home quarantine to keep the virus from spreading in case they are infected.\n\u201cPeople should remain at home to monitor for symptoms and no go out in public,\u201d Wooten said.\nFlattening the Curve\nAs the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase across the nation, the state and the County, health officials are closing schools, businesses and other institutions to try to flatten the curve of the pandemic.\nThe goal is to practice social distancing to slow the spread of the pandemic so that many people don\u2019t get sick at the same time and overwhelm the health care system. Should that occur, there might not be enough hospital beds or mechanical respirators for everyone who needs them.\n\u201cBy slowing the spread of the virus, new cases won\u2019t occur all at once,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cHospitals and health care systems can adjust and be able to handle all people who might get sick and need to be hospitalized.\u201d\nWhat Residents Can Do to Minimize Chances of Getting COVID-19\nIt\u2019s important for the public to take measures to reduce chances of getting and spreading the disease. To limit the spread of infection, you should:\n\nWash your hands\u00a0often to help protect you from germs.\nUse an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. It should contain at least 60% alcohol.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\nAvoid close contact\u00a0with people who are sick.\nIf you are sick, stay home and\u00a0keep your distance\u00a0from others to protect them from getting sick too.\nCover your mouth and nose\u00a0with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.\nPractice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.\n\nResidents should also follow these important tips to help both prepare and respond to this public health threat.\n\nStore a two-week supply of food, beverages and water, including food for family pets. Ensure an adequate supply of prescribed and routine medications are on hand.\nPlan ways to care for those who are at greater risk for serious complications and who will take care of sick family members.\nIf you have family members with increased risk of getting seriously sick, check with your medical providers about symptoms and treatment.\nCreate an emergency contact list of family and friends, teachers and employers.\nHave a plan in case your school, childcare, or employer closes temporarily.\nTalk with your children, family, and friends about what to do if an outbreak occurs and what each person would need.\n\nFollowing these steps now helps protect you and your family.\nIf you have individual questions, please talk to your healthcare provider.
