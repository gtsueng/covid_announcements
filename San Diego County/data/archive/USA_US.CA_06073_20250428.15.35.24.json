Odor complaints and hydrogen sulfide levels for communities near the river valley are provided by the regional San Diego Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD).\u00a0 Sewage spill information from the U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission can also be found here. Links to original sources are also provided so users can find out more about specific topics.\nOther dashboard highlights include information about \u201cWhat We Know,\u201d \u201cWhat We\u2019re Doing\u201d and \u201cWhat You Can Do.\u201d It also features a link to surveillance data from South County emergency departments that tracks patient health complaints related to pollution related breathing problems and potentially infectious stomach issues.\u00a0\nThe dashboard was developed by the County in partnership with UC San Diego\u2019s Resilient Shield, a multidisciplinary team collaborating to integrate advanced computing techniques like forecast modeling to facilitate informed decision making.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThis new dashboard reaffirms our commitment to the South Bay communities most impacted by the sewage pollution by providing pertinent information all in one place that they can take action on or be informed about,\u201d said Dr. Ankita Kadakia, the County\u2019s interim public health officer. \u201cI want to thank our partners with UCSD and APCD for their help in making this happen.\u201d\u00a0\nBeach and bay water closures from sewage contamination of the river valley have plagued South County for decades. Since 2018, the County has funded daily\u202fbeach water quality monitoring in the South County, including Imperial Beach, Silver Strand and Coronado.\u202f\u00a0\nMore recently, the County also has been monitoring reports of an elevation in primarily overnight hydrogen sulfide (H2S) readings in the Tijuana River Valley, creating odor issues for nearby communities.\u00a0\nThe hydrogen sulfide readings are provided by the SDAPCD\u202fwhich operates a specialized H2S analyzer network. In addition, the U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Comhttps://www.sdapcd.org/mission (USIBWC) operates a sewage treatment plant and works directly with wastewater officials in Mexico to provide data on flows into the river valley.\u202f The County also works with state and federal agency partners.\u202f\u00a0\nIn a multi-agency partnership last year, County public health experts advised SDAPCD on\u202fhydrogen sulfide\u202fguidance.\u202f\u202fThe guidance recommends that people who live in affected areas and smell the odors limit outdoor activities when they are bothersome, keep doors closed, increase air circulation with indoor fans and use air purifiers indoors.\u202f\u00a0\nAPCD also offers free purifiers for those in the three principally effected ZIP codes.\u202fThese high quality purifiers are effective for odors and gases like hydrogen sulfide particularly when equipped with permanganate filters.\u00a0\u00a0\nPeople with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other chronic lung conditions should have emergency medications such as rescue inhalers readily available. If symptoms from a strong odor persist, are worrisome or worsen, seek medical care.\u202f\u00a0\nThe County of San Diego urges federal officials to continue working with their counterparts in Mexico on stopping the flow of raw sewage and bringing an ultimate resolution to this longtime source of water and air pollution.\u00a0\nA link to the new dashboard will be located on the County website dedicated to the South Region\u2019s health concerns related to the border sewage crisis.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250428.15.35.24"}
