They may not go for a car ride with you, a leashed walk or hike with you \u00a0play fetch with you, or like to be held, but purrhaps they might.\nYou just never know. They are mysterious little creatures, who might sometimes allow themselves to be trained. Either way, they make special companions and are wonderful family pets.\nThe County\u2019s two shelters in the County remain nearly full of animals and furever homes are needed for kitties, dogs and other animals.\nAll animals adopted from County shelters will be spayed or neutered, have vaccinations, a microchip and a one-year license for dogs in the service area.\nPlease visit County Animal Services\u2019\u00a0Adoptions\u00a0page and browse the beautiful and lovable animals available now. Animal Services staff recommend that people pick out a second and third choice too, just in case your first choice is already chosen by another person. Walk-in hours are from 1 to 4 p.m. Friday and from from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at both the South Shelter, 5821 Sweetwater Road in Bonita, or the North Shelter, 2481 Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad. Fill out an application online to print or pick one up at the shelter.\nThe County Department of Animal Services\u2019 top priority is providing excellent care in its shelters while finding good homes for every healthy and treatable animal. While the goal is to find the right fit for animals and their permanent adopter to form a lasting and loving bond,\u00a0animal fostering\u00a0is another opportunity for animals to learn how to be in a home and socialize with people and other animals.\nThe Department of Animal Services protects the health, safety and welfare of people and animals. Animal Services envisions a safe, thriving community where all people and animals in San Diego County have access to essential animal care and support services.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230901.11.41.52"}
