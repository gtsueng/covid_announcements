Funds can be used to cover rent, utilities and other household expenses.\nThe expanded program will award funds for up to six months of expenses at a time and applicants can request additional funding if they still require monetary assistance after that time. The emergency rental assistance program would also give priority to single-parent households, many of which have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy.\nThe program is funded by $48.8 million in federal stimulus funds the County received earlier this month. The federal stimulus dollars will cover rental assistance needs for residents living in 16 cities in the County, as well as the unincorporated areas. The cities of San Diego and Chula Vista received their own funds from the federal government and will oversee their rental assistance programs separately.\nThe Board also voted to work with the state to develop a plan to allow a safe return to youth sports competitions.\nReturn to Purple Tier\nAfter the state lifted its seven-week Regional Stay Home Order yesterday, restaurants, museums, theaters and other businesses are now allowed to resume outdoor operations. The state made the decision to end the Stay Home Order based on projections that show the Southern California four-week intensive care unit bed availability to be above the 15% threshold it had previously established.\nWhile the end of the Stay Home Order is welcome news, County Health Officials urge San Diegans to keep their guard up.\n\u201cThis is still a precarious period, and we urge all San Diegans to continue to follow all of the health precautions we have implemented since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cPlease wash your hands, watch your distance, and wear your mask, and when it is your turn to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, get vaccinated.\u201d\nThe County is currently vaccinating people 65 and older, as well as health care workers in Phase 1A at its vaccination sites. Appointments are required, and vaccinations are available based on supply.\nMore information is at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine\u00a0and appointments can be made at\u00a0vaccinationsuperstationsd.com.\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 49.6 cases per 100,000 residents and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 12.6%, placing the County in Tier 1 or the Purple Tier.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 16.7% and it\u2019s in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.
