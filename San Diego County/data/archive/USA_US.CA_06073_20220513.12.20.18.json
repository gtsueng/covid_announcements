The program is designed to reduce food insecurity and increase food budgets to improve participant\u2019s access to fresh and healthy food.\nThe need for supplemental nutrition assistance has greatly increased over the last couple of years, in part due to the rising cost of living in the region, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCalFresh plays a critical role in filling that need, with 354,204 people in San Diego County currently receiving the benefit, up 6.8% from a year earlier. Maximum monthly amounts for qualifying households range from $250 for a single person to $835 for a household of four an up to $1,316 for a household of seven.\nIn addition to attending one of the upcoming events, San Diegans can also apply for CalFresh online at\u00a0GetCalFresh.org\u00a0and\u00a0MyBenefitsCalWIN.org, or by calling\u00a02-1-1 San Diego.
