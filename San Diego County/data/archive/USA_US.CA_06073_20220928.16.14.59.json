But they would have to pay for Vehicle-Miles-Traveled studies and potential mitigation as part of their project process.\nThat could make it more expensive for developers to build in the County\u2019s unincorporated areas that are often located farther away from jobs and amenities.\nHowever, County staff calculated the new Transportation Study Guide would allow up to 7,693 homes to be built without study and mitigation within two types of unincorporated areas \u2015 infill areas and Vehicle-Miles-Traveled efficient areas.\nThe Vehicle Miles Traveled efficient areas are places where people would drive 15% or fewer miles than drivers within the region. Infill areas are defined as those with already dense housing development \u2015 with a minimum of 425 houses and 128 intersections per square mile \u2015 and within 15 miles of job centers.\nOne of the intents of the state\u2019s Vehicle Miles Traveled law was to encourage infill development that would improve public health by encouraging people to walk and bike more and reduce car travel and greenhouse gas emissions.\nSupervisor Terra Lawson-Remer praised County staff for creating guidelines that would immediately address the \u201cclimate crisis,\u201d create a path to build more affordable homes and withstand legal challenge.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come up with an approach that simultaneously gets us to more housing and protects our climate for future generations,\u201d Lawson-Remer said.\nWith their vote Wednesday, the Board also directed County staff to work with other agencies to see if more Vehicle Miles Traveled efficient areas could be created in unincorporated communities by bringing mass transit to them.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220928.16.14.59"}
