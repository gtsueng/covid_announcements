The campaign will include a RAD regional parks events series that features a different County regional park and at least three events each month; a Ride On Mountain Biking Challenge and a Parks 101: first timer series. The latter series will teach participants outdoor essentials, under the direction of County staff, including things like how to hike and mountain-bike safely, how to camp, fish, kayak and even rock climb. It\u2019s designed specifically for those people, who for various reasons, are newcomers to outdoor experiences. Fees are waived and all equipment is provided.\nFor more information go to the County parks website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220810.16.13.56"}
