Consider protecting your pets as an area to improve in for this new decade.\nHow can this be done when you feel you are already a good pet owner? See the seven resolutions below from County Animal Services. Perhaps, you\u2019re halfway there already.\nSeven pet owner resolutions for the New Year:\n\nMake sure both your dog and cat are vaccinated against\u00a0rabies.\nLicense\u00a0your dog.\n(Those first two are legally required for dogs.)\nRegister your dog and cat with\u00a0Finding Rover, which can help you find them if they\u2019re lost.\nMicrochip\u00a0your dogs, cats and rabbits. If they\u2019re already microchipped, make sure your information is current.\nGet your dog and cat\u00a0spayed or neutered.\nCreate a\u00a0disaster plan\u00a0for your pets.\nGive your pet attention. Play catch with your dog, toss a toy to your cat, and give any furry or feathered friend the appropriate interaction. And have fun!\n\nAppointments aren\u2019t necessary for microchips or rabies vaccinations. Stop by at either one of the County\u2019s\u00a0two shelter locations\u00a0in Carlsbad or Bonita during normal business hours. They\u2019re open from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.
