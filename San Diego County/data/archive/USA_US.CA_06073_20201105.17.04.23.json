Some stations may have a limited supply.\nSand and Bags\n\nBonita: Bonita-Sunnyside Fire Station: 4900 Bonita Road, Bonita, CA 91902, P: 619-479-2346\nBoulevard: Boulevard Fire Station #47: 40080 Ribbonwood Road, Boulevard, CA 91905, P: 619-390-2020\nDe Luz:\u00a039431 De Luz Road, Fallbrook, CA 92028 P: 760-728-2422\nDulzura: Dulzura Fire Station #30: 17304 Highway 94, Dulzura, CA 91917, P: 619-468-3391\nFallbrook: Pala Mesa Fire Station #4, 4375 Pala Mesa Drive, Fallbrook, CA 92028, P: 760-723-2024\nJulian: Julian-Cuyamaca: Fire Station #56, 3407 Hwy 79, Julian, CA 92036, P: 760-765-0510\nLakeside River Park\u00a0Conservancy: 12108 Industry Road, Lakeside CA 92040P: 619-443-4770*(Closed over the weekend; open Monday-Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.)\nPalomar Mountain: Fire Station #79, 21610 Crestline Road, Palomar Mtn., CA 92060, P: 760-742-3701\nRamona: Ramona Fire Station #82, 3410 Dye Road, Ramona, CA 92065, P: 760-789-0107\nRincon: Rincon Fire Station #70: 16971 Highway 76, Pauma Valley, CA 92061, P: 760-742-3243\nValley Center: Valley Center Fire Station #2, 28205 N.
