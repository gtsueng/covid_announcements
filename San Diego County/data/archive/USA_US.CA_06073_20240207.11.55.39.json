One in five firearm-related deaths were veterans, 93.3% of that group died by suicide. \u00a0\nRecommendations in the report focused on services that support violence prevention and intervention programs, including communities at highest risk for violence, domestic and intimate partner violence and outreach programs.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe report also highlights the need for mental health care, youth mentorship programs, strict enforcement for crimes, background checks and funding for community-based organizations.\u00a0\nHearing from and collaborating with the community was at the center of the needs assessment project.
