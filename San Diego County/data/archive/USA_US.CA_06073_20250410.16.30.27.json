And you want to be safe doing it.\nSo here are a handful of tips, some online links and things to keep in mind to help you make this a great spring cleaning.\nDonate and Recycle\nGetting rid of stuff is a huge part of spring cleaning for many of us but these items don\u2019t have to end up in the landfill. You can give your usable items a second life through donation. Some alternatives include websites and groups that allow you to donate things you no longer need, like Buy Nothing, Offerup San Diego, Craigslist and local nonprofit donations centers.\nFor blue bin recyclables like paper, cardboard and cartons, metal and aluminum cans, plastic and glass bottles and containers, remember to Recycle Right by keeping your recyclable material empty, dry and loose.\nIf you have any questions about where to donate usable items and/or convenient options for proper disposal of HHW and e-waste, visit WasteFreeSD.org or check out the County Department of Public Works\u2019 recycling page, R1Earth.org.\nHousehold Hazardous Wastes\nSome materials, like Household Hazardous Waste and electronic waste, must be disposed of or recycled properly to avoid environmental harm. Everybody has them\u2014old household cleaners, paints, used motor oil, pesticides, batteries and more. It\u2019s illegal to dispose of these hazardous materials into landfills, down sewer systems or storm drains, and they need special recycling attention.\nNot to worry. Here\u2019s a link to the County\u2019s\u00a0Household Hazardous Waste Web page\u00a0with more information about it and links to places where you can safely recycle it.\nCleaning the Garage or Shed? Use Wet Cleaning Methods\nSpring cleaning is often the time we\u2019re cleaning out the garage, or tidying up that shed in the backyard, or maybe even a cabin if you have one. These are places where wild mice and rodents can get in. Unfortunately, wild rodents can potentially carry hantavirus, the dangerous virus that can be inhaled through contaminated dust, feces and urine. If you have to clean up an area where rodents have nested, be safe: NEVER sweep or vacuum. Instead, use \u201cwet cleaning\u201d methods: ventilate areas, spray them with bleach solutions or disinfectants, and use sponges and mops!\nProtect Yourself; Prevent Mosquito Breeding\nSpring cleaning is also the perfect time to get the jump on protecting yourself and your family from mosquitoes. Mosquitoes can transmit a lot of different diseases. West Nile virus is still a threat here. And last year the County had its first two \u201clocally acquired\u201d dengue fever cases\u2014meaning that for the first time, mosquitoes here in the County transmitted dengue to local residents by first biting someone who got infected traveling outside San Diego County, then returned home sick.\nSo, prevent mosquitoes from breeding. Patrol the inside and outside of your home to get rid of any standing water where mosquitoes can multiply. Dump out or remove any items that can hold water, such as plant saucers, rain gutters, buckets, garbage cans, toys, old tires, and wheelbarrows.\nHere are some County links to get more information about\u00a0West Nile virus and actions you can take to\u00a0protect yourself from mosquitoes.\nDefensible Space\nWildfires are an ever-present danger in San Diego County. So help protect yourself, your family and your property, and give firefighters a safe area where they can potentially defend your home from fire by creating 100 feet of \u201cdefensible space.\u201d Don\u2019t wait for the summer heat. Remove debris, including dry leaves, firewood stacks and trash (including on the roof and in rain gutters); trim away tree branches that overhang your home and cut low branches on trees; prune or remove dried-out bushes and plants; and properly dispose of tree and shrub clippings in a bin.
