The tsunami also flooded Japan\u2019s Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant, which melted its cores and leaked radiation. More than 18,000 people died, and many others were reported missing.\nThe California coast experienced over $100 million in damage. Locally, tsunami surges and strong currents caused flooding and minor damage, mainly to the boating community. The County of San Diego Office of Emergency Services and San Diego County\u2019s hazardous materials division also worked with local, state and federal agencies to develop emergency plans to document and handle debris that could potentially wash ashore in the years following.\nThe events on March 11, 2011 have helped shape local and statewide emergency planning and preparedness efforts and serve as a lasting reminder of the importance of being prepared. While tsunamis are rare along San Diego\u2019s 70 miles of coastline, it is important to know your risks and be prepared. Whether you work, live, or visit the coast, here are some simple and no-cost steps you can take to be this tsunami preparedness week to be ready for tsunamis:\n\nUse the Know Your Hazards map tool to discover your level of risk for local hazards, like tsunamis.\nMake a disaster plan for yourself and loved ones.\nRegister your cell phone and email with AlertSanDiego, the region\u2019s emergency mass notification system.\nReview your local tsunami evacuation routes and know important landmarks and potential flood areas.\nKnow what to do: If you are on the beach or in a low-lying coastal area and feel a strong earthquake \u2013 drop, cover, and hold on, and then immediately move inland and to higher ground to a safe location.\nIf you have school age children or are a teacher \u2013 watch and share this video with your classroom.
