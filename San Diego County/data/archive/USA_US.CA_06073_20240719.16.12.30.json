Sometimes they will just post advertisements on social media like Snapchat saying \u201cDrivers needed. Easy money,\u201d she said.\nRecruiters tell the youth that it\u2019s easy and they won\u2019t get caught. And even if they do get caught, there won\u2019t be any consequences because they are minors, Urias said. That simply is not true and those who are caught face detention or prison if they are already 18.\nBe Aware of Fentanyl\u2019s Dangers \nJust 2 mg of fentanyl is considered a potentially lethal dose, and it is often mixed into all illicitly produced pills, said Kelly McKay, DEA public affairs specialist. There are no standards to prevent lethal dosing. McKay warned teens never to take any pills that are offered to them or are not dispensed by a legitimate pharmacy.\nUse Caution on the Internet\nDA prosecutor Cheryl Sueing-Jones talked to the group on the dangers of the internet and how predators pose as children in popular games trying to get them into chat rooms. Once they have the child in the room, they may try to get information for identity theft or expose them to sexual content and ask for explicit pictures in return. Through social media, she\u00a0said children are exposed to cyberbullying and access to deadly drugs. It is important for parents to talk to their children about these issues and rehearse ways to respond to them before they occur, Sueing-Jones said.\nSeveral San Diego teenagers, who are part of the Community Wraparound program, attended to listen to the presentations and said the information resonated with them and was on point with what they experience as teens.\n\u201cI found the information like really impactful because personally, I have little sisters so knowing they are on those social media games. It really hit me because I realize they really could be talking to anybody and we never know what their intentions are until it\u2019s too late,\u201d said one teen in the audience. \u201cThey have an attachment to that game, to that social media. I don\u2019t think I could take it away from them, my parents can\u2019t either, they\u2019ve tried. I might just warn them, so they don\u2019t friend anyone or talk to anyone that they don\u2019t know in real life.\u201d\nYouth Symposium attendees and Probation community partners posed for a photo with the DEA teddy bear.\nAfter the presentations, Nelson was joined by Lisa Weinreb, chief of the Juvenile Branch of the San Diego District Attorney\u2019s Office; Tilisha T. Martin, assistant supervising judge of the Juvenile Court; and Frank Barone, supervising attorney of the Public Defender\u2019s Juvenile Justice branch where each took questions.\nJudge Martin specifically reached out to the young people in attendance to tell them, \u201cYou can do what you put your mind to, but you have to have the drive and the willpower and not let anyone deter you. Because I can tell you it takes a lot of courage to not go along to get along, you have to be the odd \u2014 woman, man, boy, child, other, them, their, his, or her \u2014 out.\n\u201cOkay so I\u2019m just putting that out there for you because when people come into the courtroom that I sit in, I often hear, wow, I didn\u2019t know there were judges that looked like me. And being the fifth African American woman appointed to the bench in San Diego County, I tell you it carries a lot of responsibility. But I know that the purpose of having that opportunity is to hopefully impart upon others that I come in contact with that you have the same ability to be successful just like me,\u201d Judge Martin said.
