A spate of police killings led to renewed calls for social justice and racial equity worldwide.

At-risk businesses could apply for economic help. Struggling renters in the unincorporated area saw a moratorium on evictions. And the County made broad changes to address inequities in the region.\nBefore these unforeseen challenges, the Annual Report looks into the County\u2019s strides in meeting or exceeding goals in five of its priority areas: helping the most vulnerable in the region, improving housing affordability, transforming the public safety and justice system, protecting our natural resources and investing in our neighborhoods.\nThis past year, the County addressed the increased need for behavioral health services, bolstered aid to those experiencing homelessness, and began transforming its juvenile justice and foster care systems.\nMore affordable housing became available as part of the County\u2019s goal to double the number of units over five years to more than 5,000.\nA community air protection program expanded, a new electric vehicle roadmap was approved, and 354 tons of air pollutant emissions were removed.\nThe County opened its first archive and first bike park. Construction is underway for a new fire station and phase one of a juvenile justice campus. A new library is planned for Lakeside and the Southeastern Live Well Center is going into the design phase.\nThe Annual Report also allows you to meet the County Board of Supervisors, outlines how departments are organized and lists our top awards.
