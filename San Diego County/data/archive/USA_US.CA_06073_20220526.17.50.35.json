Both antiviral pills and monoclonal antibodies are available at the MARCs.\n\u201cWe know treatments work and can lower the risk of severe illness and hospitalization by nearly 90 percent,\u201d said Jennifer Tuteur, M.D., County deputy chief medical officer. \u201cIf you test positive for COVID, please isolate from others and seek treatment as soon as you can if you develop symptoms and are at high risk.\u201d\nTreatment can prevent a person from progressing to more severe illness, therefore cutting down on need for hospitalizations and risk of dying from COVID. The antiviral pills are available at multiple locations and community pharmacies across San Diego, including Test to Treat sites (1-888-634-1123). Antiviral pills must be prescribed by a health care provider and started within five days of symptoms to be effective. Monoclonal antibodies must be started within seven days.\nTo determine which treatment is best for you, talk to your doctor or health care provider, or call 2-1-1 to find a provider.\nMARCs operate seven days a week with locations in Vista, Clairemont, Hillcrest, and Chula Vista. MARCs offer treatment with the antiviral pill Paxlovid and the monoclonal antibody Bebtelovimab, both of which are effective against the Omicron variant.\nYou can call (619) 685-2500 to schedule a no-cost appointment at the MARCs, regardless of health insurance or immigration status. A referral or prescription is not required.\nLearn more about all options on the County\u2019s COVID-19 Treatment page.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220526.17.50.35"}
