Many who lose their pay don\u2019t know how to get help recovering their earnings.\n\u201cWage theft is a grave injustice that affects many in San Diego County, especially our most vulnerable workers,\u201d said County Board Chairwoman Nora Vargas. \u201cThis grant empowers us to strengthen our efforts to protect workers\u2019 rights and hold employers accountable for exploitation.\u201d\nSan Diego County sees roughly $2 million in wage theft losses every year.\n\u201cWe are holding companies accountable that steal money from their workers and fail to pay the wages they have been promised,\u201d said Board Vice Chair Terra Lawson-Remer. \u201cWe established the County\u2019s Office of Labor Standards to protect workers and this new program to prosecute bad employers is a significant step forward. I am thankful California\u2019s Labor Commissioner awarded us this funding, OLSE will put it to good use, and help as many people as possible.\u201d\nThe County\u2019s Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement was established in 2021 to educate employers and workers about employment laws, and workers\u2019 rights.\nThe office administers the Workplace Justice Fund which has helped 34 victims of wage theft.\nThe DA\u2019s Workplace Justice Unit was also created in 2021 and was one of the first in California to investigate and prosecute criminal wage theft cases.\n\u201cWage theft is oppressive and impacts the livelihood and dignity of hard-working people. This is why it has been a priority for our office to hold those who steal wages accountable through felony wage theft prosecutions,\u201d said District Attorney Summer Stephan. \u201cWith this grant, we will be able to expand our efforts in partnership with our county partners and further protect workers. I want to thank California\u2019s Labor Commissioner Lilia Garcia-Brower for her trust in us and awarding us this valuable grant.\u201d\nThe DA\u2019s office investigates criminal wage theft cases, County Counsel addresses violations of labor laws through civil enforcement actions and OLSE educates employers about labor laws and workers about their rights.\n\u201cWage theft victims in San Diego County are not alone. There is help.\u201d said OLSE Director Branden Butler. \u201cPeople have a right to the wages they\u2019ve earned and we\u2019re here to help workers recover the money they are owed.\u201d\nFor more information on workers\u2019 rights or wage theft, contact the Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement at 619-531-5129 or call the DA workplace justice hotline at 1-866-402-6044.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240801.14.58.09"}
