The 51 cases in this outbreak represent 13% of the 402 total cases reported to date in San Diego County.\nThe County Public Health shigella website includes an epidemiological curve showing declining case numbers in recent weeks.\nThe cases are among individuals experiencing homelessness, with the majority at multiple locations in central San Diego and two cases in North County.\nNo source of the outbreak has currently been identified.\nThe County continues to work closely with the City of San Diego, regional homeless service providers and others to identify new cases, prevent future potential exposures and promote good hygienic and sanitation precautions.\nShigella is a contagious infection typically spread by contaminated surfaces, food or water, or person to person. Those at increased risk include young children (especially those in daycare), people who are experiencing homelessness, travelers to locations with poor sanitation and men who have sex with men. In 2020, a total of 240 shigellosis cases were reported in San Diego County residents while the 426 cases reported in 2019 was the highest since 1995.\nTypical symptoms of shigellosis include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever and stomach cramps. While most people will recover fully without antibiotic treatment, some individuals with poor immune systems can develop life-threatening disease and may need further treatment.\u00a0 People with symptoms that resemble shigella should contact their medical care provider. The provider may order stool testing to help with the diagnosis.\nStrategies to avoid getting or spreading shigella include frequent hand washing and not preparing food while ill with diarrhea.\nMore information about shigella and precautions are available through the County, a California Health Alert Network notification, the California Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The next regularly scheduled shigella outbreak news release will appear Thursday, December 30.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211217.16.45.15"}
