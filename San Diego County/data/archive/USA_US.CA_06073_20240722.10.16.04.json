An ECMO machine is used to pump blood out of a patient\u2019s body, add oxygen, remove carbon dioxide, and then pump the blood back into the body.\nIn 2022, San Diego County brought local medical leaders together to create the San Diego Resuscitation Consortium (SDRC), with the goal of saving more lives using ECMO. A new system of care was established, and last year, the County launched the \u201cExtracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR)\u201d pilot program.\nParamedics identify patients in the community and take them to one of three local hospitals, Sharp Memorial, Scripps La Jolla and Sharp Grossmont, that joined the program. In just one year, the Emergency Physicians who placed patients in full cardiac arrest outside of the hospital on ECMO, saved lives that would have without question, been lost. The program may soon become a new standard and transform cardiac arrest care worldwide.\nNot all patients suffering sudden cardiac arrest are good candidates for the program. For those who are, ECMO can bring them back from certain death. Patients like Michelle Alvarado are living proof.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240722.10.16.04"}
