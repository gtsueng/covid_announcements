Unvaccinated people should wear face coverings outdoors whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained.\nFace coverings are required in most indoor settings, regardless of vaccination status. More information about the current face covering guidance is available here.\nVaccination Progress:\n\nDoses delivered: Over 3.84 million.\nDoses administered: More than 3.34 million.\nReceived at least one shot: Close to 1.8 million or 64.2% of San Diegans 12 and older.\nFully vaccinated: About 1.35 million or 48.3%.\nThe goal: fully vaccinate\u00a075% of San Diego County residents 12 and older or 2,101,936 people.\nTo date, 85.6% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 64.4% are fully vaccinated.
