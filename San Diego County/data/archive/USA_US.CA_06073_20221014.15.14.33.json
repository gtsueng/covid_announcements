These services include employment assistance, housing support, interpretation, referrals to legal services and health screenings.\nOIRA held two listening sessions to hear from service providers, community-based organizations, and members of the public to learn what they wanted to see in the Welcome Center, including which specific providers should offer services and resources.\n\u201cWe are already receiving some valuable feedback from our community about their needs. This space is for them. Our goal is to be open-armed and provide much-needed support as they settle into their lives here in San Diego County,\u201d said Lucero Chavez Basilio, OIRA Director. \u201cWhen we work together with the community and our partners, we can alleviate some of the stress individuals and families face.\u201d\nCurrently, San Ysidro Health, Alliance for African Assistance, Jewish Family Service, SBCS and the Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition are working collaboratively with OIRA and the list continues to grow.\nListening sessions are expected to continue with another meeting in the works for the end of the year.\nThe Welcome Center will be located at 401 Mile of Cars Way in National City inside the South Region Live Well Center.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20221014.15.14.33"}
