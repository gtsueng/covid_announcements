It takes longer to stop when roads are wet. Allow yourself at least an extra 15 minutes or so to arrive at your destination to adjust for slower traffic.\nTurn on your headlights to see better and make it easier for other drivers to see you. It\u2019s the law.\nTry to drive toward the middle lanes as water tends to gather in outside lanes.\nDefog your windows for better visibility. Rain can cause windows to fog up. Along the same lines, check your windshield wipers preferably before it rains again and replace them as needed.\nAvoid driving through deep water because it can affect your brakes. If you cannot avoid it, test your brakes afterward to make sure they\u2019ve dried out and are working properly.\nTurn around, don\u2019t drown. In heavy rains, never drive through a flooded roadway if you cannot see the pavement. Even a few inches of water running at the right velocity can sweep a car, and even a truck, and its occupants off the roadway and downstream. You should not walk or swim across a flooded roadway either.\nGive the cars in front of you extra distance. The spray from their vehicles \u2014 particularly from larger trucks and buses \u2014 can hamper your vision. And giving extra space to the guy in front of you also gives you more time to brake or adjust if you need to do so.\nKeep calm, don\u2019t oversteer or stomp on the brakes if you start to hydroplane or skid when your tires lose traction with the wet road. The Department of Motor Vehicles says keep the steering wheel straight and take your foot off the accelerator so your vehicle can slow down slowly.\nStay focused. Remember, it\u2019s illegal, and dangerous, to try to text or use a hand-held cell phone when you\u2019re driving.\n\u00a0Slow down for the cone zone if you see highway or road workers ahead or to your side. Watch out for public works crews and equipment.\n\nAs they have in the past, the County and CAL FIRE are providing free bags and/or sand at numerous fire stations for people who live in the unincorporated areas.\nRain can cause flooding and erosion, particularly in areas that are not covered by plants, landscaping, grass and trees. Rain runoff can sweep topsoil, mud, plant material and debris off land and downstream where it can damage homes, clog culverts and storm drains, and flood and damage roadways.\nSand and bags, or bags alone, will be available for unincorporated residents at the fire stations located below.\nPeople should call ahead to double-check availability and remember to bring a shovel to fill the bags. Some stations may have a limited supply.\nSand and bags\n\nBonita: Bonita-Sunnyside Fire Station #38: 4900 Bonita Road, Bonita, CA 91902, P: 619-479-2346\nBoulevard: Boulevard Fire Station #47: 40080 Ribbonwood Road, Boulevard, CA 91905, P: 619-390-2020\nDe Luz: De Luz Fire Station #16: 39431 De Luz Road, Fallbrook, CA 92028 P: 760-728-2422\nDulzura: Dulzura Fire Station #30: 17304 Highway 94, Dulzura, CA 91917, P: 619-468-3391\nFallbrook: Pala Mesa Fire Station #4, 4375 Pala Mesa Drive, Fallbrook, CA 92028, P: 760-723-2005\nPalomar Mountain: Palomar Mountain Fire Station #79, 21610 Crestline Road, Palomar Mtn., CA 92060, P: 760-742-3701\nPotrero: Potrero Fire Station #31 25130 Highway 94, Potrero, CA 91963 P: 619-478-5544\nRamona: Ramona Fire Station #81, 24462 San Vicente Road, Ramona, CA 92065 P: 760-789-9465\nRamona: Ramona Fire Station #82, 3410 Dye Road, Ramona, CA 92065, P: 760-789-0107\nRincon: Rincon Fire Station #70: 16971 Highway 76, Pauma Valley, CA 92061, P: 760-742-3243\nValley Center: Valley Center Fire Station #2, 28205 N.
