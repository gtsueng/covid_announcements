The fires should remind people to be prepared to evacuate and to take steps to minimize damage to their property in case a wildfire starts in their community.\nPlease note that during hot, dry conditions, such as when a red flag warning is issued, people should not attempt to use power tools to clear or reduce brush, as this could spark a fire that can spread to grass and other brush.\nAssess your personal disaster plan and readiness now rather than in the middle of an emergency.\n\nRegister cell phones \u00ad\u2013yours and other family members\u2013with\u00a0AlertSanDiego so that you will all be notified of an emergency affecting your community. This is especially important if you no longer have a landline at your home.\nIf you own an iOS or Android phone, download the\u00a0SDEmergency .\u00a0 It\u00a0is a great resource for a wide variety of preparedness tips.\nReview your\u00a0disaster plan, or create one if you don\u2019t have one yet.\nBe prepared to evacuate with only minutes\u2019 notice. Practice evacuating with your family at least twice a year. Make contingency plans for different times of the day, such as a fire breaking out while some family members are at work or school.\nCheck that you have all the necessary items handy to take with you if you had to evacuate. Make sure food, water and medications have not expired and that every family member\u2019s dietary or medical needs are represented.\nCheck with schools or childcare providers to make sure you are aware of emergency plans and how you will be contacted.\nDiscuss where to reunite in case you are separated from your family during a disaster. Phone service may not be reliable during a disaster.\nMake sure your pets are microchipped you have evacuation items for them as well \u2013 including crates for small pets \u2013 and evacuation plans for larger animals such as horses or livestock.\nMake sure your homeowner\u2019s insurance policy is up to date, covers wildfires and insures all the contents of your home.\nTake a walk around your property and ensure that you have a minimum of 100 feet of defensible space and have no overhanging tree branches on your roof.\u00a0 Move any wood piles or combustible items that could catch fire a safe distance away from your home. The goal is to remove items that would catch your home on fire if a burning ember landed on them. Remove any dead or dying trees or plants or leaves that could spread fire.\n\nIf possible, reach out to friends and family members, especially older adults or people with disabilities, and review their plans and supplies with them.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230811.11.51.45"}
