The sites are:\n\nSouth Region Live Well Center \u2013 Chula Vista\nMartin Luther King Community Center \u2013 National City\nMar Vista High School \u2013 Imperial Beach\nSouthwestern College \u2013 San Ysidro\n\nThe reserved appointments will be filled through outreach by community health workers or promotoras who are contacting people 65 and older at locations that include grocery stores, faith centers, food distribution sites and housing complexes in the South Bay.\nRescheduled Appointments\nDue to delays in vaccine shipments to San Diego, the County is rescheduling approximately 1,000 first-dose appointments at its sites on Thursday and Friday. Those affected are being notified they will be rescheduled for next week.\nAdditional Vaccine Information\nThe Metropolitan Transit System is offering free rides to people with proof of a vaccination appointment and 2-1-1 San Diego and promotoras also have the capacity to arrange for transportation.\nCurrently, all County vaccination super stations and points of dispensing, or PODs, are vaccinating people in Phase 1A and people 65 years and older in Phase 1B. All require appointments which can be made at\u00a0vaccinationsuperstationsd.com.\nCounty clinics are only vaccinating people in Phase 1A and those 65 and older in Phase 1B.\nTo date, more than 765,000 COVID-19 doses have been delivered to the region. Of those, over 663,000 have been administered, including more than 135,000 San Diegans who have received two doses and are fully vaccinated. So far, 17.6% of the population over age 16 has received at least one dose. More information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s vaccination dashboard.\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 22.2 cases per 100,000 residents and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 6.4%, placing the County in Tier 2 or the Red Tier. While the testing positivity rate for the County qualifies it for the Red Tier, the state uses the most restrictive metric \u2013 in this case the adjusted case rate \u2013 and assigns counties to that tier. Therefore, the County remains in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 9.7% and it\u2019s in the Purple Tier or Tier 1. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance to a less restrictive tier.\nThe California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 23.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nFour new community outbreaks were confirmed Feb. 16: three in business settings and one in a grocery setting.\nIn the past seven days (Feb. 10 through Feb 16), 44 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n13,771 tests were reported to the County on Feb. 16, and the percentage of new positive cases was 4%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 5.5%.
