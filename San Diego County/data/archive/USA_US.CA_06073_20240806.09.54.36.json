They are\u00a0El Capitan County Preserve\u00a0in Lakeside and\u00a0Mt. Gower County Preserve\u00a0in Ramona.\nThese locations have difficult trails that end in isolated areas. They also offer very limited shade which can lead to dangerous conditions during major heat events. They join two desert parks that are already closed for the summer due to extreme heat:\u00a0Vallecito\u00a0and\u00a0Agua Caliente\u00a0County Parks.\nClosing parks is always a last resort, but it is done to reduce heat-related incidents like heat exhaustion and\u00a0heat stroke.\n\u201cWhen we close park gates, it\u2019s to reduce health risks and related injuries caused by severe weather events \u2013 for guests as well as for our own team members who are called to assist in emergency situations,\u201d said Brian Albright, director of the County of San Diego Department of Parks and Recreation.\nThe closures also provide County Parks and Recreation staff an opportunity to conduct needed maintenance including trail restoration. This work is done in the early morning or evening while it is cooler.\nThe County will continue to work safely to improve your park experience and look forward to welcoming you back to El Capitan and Mt. Gower County Preserves in September.\nThere are more than 100 other County parks and preserves to explore during the month of August \u2013 like\u00a0Waterfront Park and its new active recreation area. It\u2019s open daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.\nIf it is really hot, consider staying home or plan your next hike by taking one of these\u00a0virtual tours\u00a0of some of the County\u2019s most popular trails.\nIf you do go out for a hike, be smart about it! Here are some\u00a0safety tips to consider:\n\nLet someone know where you will be and when you plan to return.\nHike with others, never alone.\nLeave your dog at home\u00a0for difficult hikes. Even \u201ceasy\u201d hikes may be too much for your dog when the air or ground are too hot.\nTake plenty of water to stay hydrated.\u00a0Rangers recommend\u00a0one liter (about a quart) for every 2 to 3 miles.\nWear sunscreen, a hat and sunglasses.\nTake breaks in shade, if possible.\nTake a fully charged\u00a0mobile phone, map and/or GPS.\nWear lightweight, light-colored, ventilated clothing.\nBring along a warm jacket if you plan to stay out after dusk.\nWear sturdy shoes with traction for slippery rocks.\nFollow all posted safety rules.\nBring ample food, sunscreen to reapply, a flashlight, first aid kit, multi-purpose tool and\u00a0a whistle.\nKnow your limitations; choose trails that match your level of physical fitness and areas where you are not going to get lost.\n\nFor additional information on visiting County Parks, visit\u00a0sdparks.org.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240806.09.54.36"}
