The implicated carrots are organic, whole bagged carrots and baby carrots sold under multiple brands by Grimmway Farms.\u00a0\nOne person in San Diego who consumed the carrots became ill from the same strain of Shiga Toxin producing E. Coli\u202f(STEC) that is part of a multi-state outbreak. Thirty-nine people infected with the outbreak strain of E. coli have been reported from 18 states. Fifteen people have been hospitalized, and one person has died.\u00a0\nE.\u202fcoli\u202fcan cause severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting, often within three to four days. The STEC found in the carrots can cause hospitalization and even death. Grimmway Farms has issued a nationwide recall.\u202fThe carrots are likely no longer in stores for sale but may be in your home.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you or a loved one are feeling sick, contact your doctor as soon as possible,\u201d\u202fsaid Ankita Kadakia, M.D., interim County public health officer. \u201cThe Shiga toxin producing\u202fE. Coli bacteria can cause serious kidney problems that require hospitalization, so it is important to get care promptly.\u201d\u00a0\nIf you think you purchased affected carrots, do not eat them. Throw them away and wash any containers or surfaces that touched the carrots with hot soapy water or in the dishwasher.\u202f Make sure to also wash your hands with soap and water after handling the carrots or container.\u00a0\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241126.14.28.52"}
