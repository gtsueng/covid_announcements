The Pfizer/BioNTech is for those age 12 and over, while the Moderna bivalent booster is for those age 18 and older.\n\u201cThese new boosters are a welcome resource to our ongoing COVID-19 prevention efforts,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThe virus remains very prevalent in our community. With this bivalent vaccine, we have an updated booster that more directly addresses the most common circulating variant, and a chance to better protect our community. I encourage everyone eligible to get boosted.\u201d\nIndividuals may contact their healthcare provider or other vaccine provider, such as a pharmacy, for other local availability. Availability at County vaccine events will be updated on coronavirus-sd.com and appointments can be made through the state\u2019s My Turn system. Initial supplies are expected to be limited.\nSimilar to last year, the boosters will be offered along with the flu vaccine.
