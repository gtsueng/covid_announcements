What won\u2019t change is our commitment to treating these young people as adolescents, not adults since adolescent brain science tells us that brains don\u2019t finish developing until the mid-20s,\u201d said Interim Chief Probation Officer Cesar Escuro. \u201cWe have a final, unique opportunity to support justice-involved young people by providing clinical support, education, and career development services that can help them permanently exit the justice system and thrive.\u201d\nThe program will include career and academic support services, positive youth development programming, behavioral health treatment programming, reentry support, and support for families to participate in care. Long-term needs for post-high school academic and career development services would also be identified for the program youth. The youth will be at the East Mesa Juvenile Detention Facility in two living units, which will be renovated to be more home-like in preparation for longer use.\nCurrently, the state\u2019s Division of Juvenile Justice takes custody of these youth in another program that is separate from the adult population and will end in 2023. The program typically has 50 to 55 youth in that program throughout a year.\nIn this decade, San Diego County Probation has transformed its approach to justice-involved youth. To do this, Probation has enhanced its prevention, early intervention, and diversion strategies by including more direct mental health and trauma services, deepening collaboration with school districts, and supporting the needs of the entire family.\nThe positive outcomes of this are a nearly 70% reduction in Probation\u2019s juvenile detention population and a 75% reduction of those on community supervision in the last seven years.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211019.17.39.03"}
