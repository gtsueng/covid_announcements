The criteria fall within three categories: the number of San Diegans with influenza-like illness and COVID-19 symptoms; the percentage of positive tests compared to number of tests performed; and the capacity of hospitals to deal with all patients and robust testing.\nThe County also is working with representatives of other local jurisdictions to develop phased public access to parks, beaches and other places.\n\u201cCounty decisions must be based on objective and data-driven information,\u201d Wooten said.\nMore Case Information\nThe County\u2019s COVID-19 webpage contains a\u00a0graph showing new positive cases and total cases reported by date.\u00a0The data is also broken down by ethnic group.
