The property is close to the Mira Mesa Community Park, Senior Center, Library, and Mira Mesa High School.\nThe County\u2019s Department of Parks and Recreation worked with the City of San Diego to launch this project. The property will be leased to the County for a 45-year term.\nThe epicentre served Mira Mesa from 1977 to 2016. It closed in 2016 due to financial hardship experienced by the operator and has remained vacant.\nThe County will be the sole operator of the facility and will be funding the building repairs. The total project cost is $10.5 million. Construction is expected to begin in early 2025.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240717.12.21.22"}
