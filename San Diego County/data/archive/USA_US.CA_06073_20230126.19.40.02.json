Another study showed that the bivalent vaccine also protects against severe disease.\nWastewater surveillance shows that those variants, XBB and XBB.1.5, make up about 25% of the virus circulating in San Diego County. The County Health and Human Services Agency continues to urge people to get vaccinated with the booster to protect themselves\u2014particularly people who are 65 years of age and older. Those people are the group most at risk of suffering serious complications, including death, from the COVID-19 virus.\n\u201cCOVID-19 virus variants are still widespread in our county and it\u2019s important that people protect themselves by getting vaccinated if they haven\u2019t been already,\u201d said County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. \u201cWhile cases, hospitalizations and deaths are decreasing, these events are still occurring in San Diego County. These new studies reinforce the data that bivalent boosters, can protect you, your family and friends from getting seriously ill or dying.\u201d\nThe\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u00a0and\u00a0California Department of Public Health\u00a0a recommend a bivalent booster for everyone six months of age and older.\u00a0Previous CDC studies have reported that people who have not been vaccinated run much higher risks of dying from COVID-19 than those who have been vaccinated.\nTo date, more than 540,000 San Diegans have gotten vaccinated with the bivalent COVID-19 booster since it became available here in September 2022.

The County continues to offer vaccinations throughout the region at its\u00a0vaccination\u00a0sites.\u202fCheck online\u202ffor the days and hours sites will be open.\nPreventive Measures\u202f\u00a0\u00a0\nIn addition to vaccination and staying home when ill, San Diegans can take other precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include:\n\nCleaning hands thoroughly and often.\nStaying away from sick people.\nWearing a facial covering, especially in crowded indoor settings.\nRegularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces.\nConducting home testing when exposed or when ill. The federal government is providing free at-home COVID-19 tests available again through the winter for a limited time.
