Doing it now can prevent 90% of future cancers caused by HPV.\u201d\u00a0\nAugust also is a good time for everyone to revisit vaccine records because it is\u202fNational Immunization Awareness Month. This annual observance highlights the importance of getting recommended vaccines throughout your life.\u00a0\nMore information about school vaccines and where to get them is available on the\u202fCounty website\u202for by calling 211.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240725.08.42.28"}
