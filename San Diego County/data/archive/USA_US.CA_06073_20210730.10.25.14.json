Also, there are about 54,000 San Diegans who have the viral infection but do not know it.\nHepatitis C, for which there is no vaccine, is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus, different from the viruses that cause hepatitis A and B.\nThe virus typically goes unnoticed since most people who contract it will not show symptoms until they develop long-term complications. Acute hepatitis C typically occurs within six months of exposure and symptoms include fever, fatigue, dark urine, nausea, vomiting and jaundice.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210730.10.25.14"}
