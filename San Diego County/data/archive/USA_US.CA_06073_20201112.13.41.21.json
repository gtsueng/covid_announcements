But Parker said this week that he was excited to return, not just to come back to San Diego, but to be involved in a key moment of nationwide change to \u201cimprove law enforcement and community relations.\u201d\n\u201cThe challenges that CLERB faces now with expanded oversight approved by the Board (in June),\u201d Parker said, \u201cthe increase in staff, the movement of CLERB to the County\u2019s Finance and General Government Group, and with the national trend of improving law enforcement and community relations, all that together is why I jump at the challenge.\u201d\nCLERB Board Chairwoman Susan Youngflesh said the agency was eager to have Parker back, someone with extensive experience in the law enforcement and the investigatory field, who has already done the job and proven to have familiar relationships with both the Sheriff\u2019s and Probation departments.\nParker was a police officer for 10 years before spending most of the last 20 years in the medical examiner/coroner field in San Diego; Phoenix, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Los Angeles.\nCLERB was created by San Diego County voters in 1990 to provide independent investigation and oversight of the County\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s and Probation departments. Part of its authority includes oversight of all County jails in the unincorporated areas and in the nine cities that use the County\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Department to provide law enforcement.\nIn June, the County Board of Supervisors approved increasing CLERB\u2019s independence and strengthening its oversight. The action came in response to protests here and across the country after the police killing in May of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nThe Board\u2019s action included:\n\nDirecting CLERB to increase community involvement in the appointment process for its 11-member, volunteer board of directors\nMoving CLERB from the County\u2019s Public Safety Group, which includes the Sheriff\u2019s and Probation departments, to the Finance and General Government Group \u201cto make sure CLERB is independent from the departments it is tasked with overseeing\u201d\nExpanding CLERB\u2019s investigatory authority, funding and staffing\n\nBefore the Board action, CLERB already had the ability to subpoena witnesses and evidence in its investigations, but its investigatory power had limits. CLERB was authorized to investigate, without a complaint, all deaths arising out of or in connection to actions of peace officers or custodial officers employed by the Sheriff\u2019s Department or Probation Department.\nBeyond that, CLERB could only investigate instances when a member of the public signed an official complaint. If people were hesitant for any reason to sign complaints, the agency could not investigate, even if CLERB felt there was merit to those complaints.\nThe Board of Supervisors vote in June changes that. CLERB will have the authority to investigate, without public complaints, any incidents that involve County custodial, Sheriff\u2019s or Probation officers and: the discharge of a firearm; use of force resulting in great bodily injury; and use of force in protests or other events protected by the First Amendment.\nParker said one of CLERB\u2019s first goals will be to increase community outreach in San Diego County, to better acquaint the public with CLERB\u2019s role and work, to be \u201cmore proactive\u201d with the public it serves.\n\u201cI think this is the ideal time to be executive director of a civilian oversight entity in the United States,\u201d Parker said. \u201cAnd with my experience here in San Diego, already forming and having relationships, knowing the players involved at both the Sheriff\u2019s and Probation departments \u2026 this is an exciting time. We have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20201112.13.41.21"}
