This new team is an alternative to dispatching law enforcement when a person is having a psychiatric crisis.\u201d\nThe North County MCRT pilot is responding to calls in the communities of Del Mar, Carlsbad, Vista, Encinitas, Solana Beach, Oceanside and Camp Pendleton. Teams provide non-law enforcement crisis intervention, triage and assessment services in the field to connect people to additional care, when needed, to prevent acute psychiatric crises from escalating.\n\u201cMental health, homelessness and drug use frequently intersect with the criminal justice system and too often the outcomes fall short of helping people who face these challenges,\u201d District Attorney Summer Stephan said. \u201cThat\u2019s why our Blueprint for Mental Health Reform recommended (these) Mobile Crisis Response Teams \u2014 so that those suffering mental health crisis get a compassionate and effective response while at the same time keeping our region safe.\n\u201cI often hear from mothers whose sons who have stopped taking their medication,\u201d Stephan said, \u201cand begin exhibiting signs of distress and are in need immediate help from professionals, but are only left with the alternative of calling police. The MCRT will give these families another option.\u201d\nCounty Behavioral Health Services Assistant Director Cecily Thornton-Stearns emphasized that the MCRT respond to psychiatric emergencies only when they\u2019re deemed not to involve threats of violence. She said the makeup of the teams, which consist of licensed mental health clinicians, case managers and peer support specialists, was extremely important.\n\u201cThese clinical teams can triage and link the individual to appropriate services,\u201d Thornton-Stearns said, \u201cand can even provide transportation if needed. If a situation evolves and requires the presence of law enforcement, team members can call for assistance, and PERT (Psychiatric Emergency Response Team), or other uniformed personnel, will be dispatched.\u201d\nThe program operates during normal business hours through the Access and Crisis Line, with on-call capacity for after hours, and may expand based on utilization. Services are provided through an HHSA contract with Exodus Recovery, Inc., an experienced provider of crisis care.\nAdditional teams will also be ramping up throughout the county over the next year and may utilize 911 call dispatch. As services expand, the County will continue to work closely with the law enforcement community to ensure the safety of MCRT staff and residents remains a priority.\nCounty officials said providing access to care is essential to the County\u2019s\u00a0Live Well San Diego\u00a0vision, which aims to improve the health and safety of all residents.\nThe County funds prevention and treatment services throughout the region. If you, or someone you care about, needs treatment, please call the Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210308.13.59.22"}
