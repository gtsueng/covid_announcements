Classes focus on building strength, balance, cardio and flexibility. There are nearly 40 classes a week held in person or virtually throughout the region. Tai Chi classes are also available. \u00a0\nMeals and Senior Dining: hot, nutritious meals are served for people over 60 years old weekly at nearly 30 locations around the region. Many locations also offer transportation.\u00a0\u00a0\nTech2Connect: gives internet-connected tablets and technology training to encourage social connection and resources for mental health. The program is available to eligible In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) recipients who live alone and are at greatest risk of social isolation by calling (858)505-6972.\u00a0\nMultipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP): helps eligible older adults stay in their home by providing help with certain tasks like laundry, shopping or making bill payments.\u00a0\u00a0\nVolunteer opportunities: older adults can find social connections and serve the community in a variety of ways through Senior Volunteers in Action (SVA) or the Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP). Volunteers can also serve in the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program to visit long-term care sites to ensure residents receive quality care and advocate for their rights.\u00a0\n\nTo learn more about available resources or to report suspected elder abuse, contact the County Aging & Independence Services Call Center at 800-339-4661 or visit their website. \u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240524.10.42.53"}
