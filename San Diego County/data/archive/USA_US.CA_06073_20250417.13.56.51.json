It expands the fleet of two existing Live WoWs and a recently added HIV, STD, and Hepatitis Live WoW bringing the total number to four mobile vehicles available for use.\nThe nearly 12-foot-long Winnebago Freightliner will serve as a rolling public health resource, expanding the County\u2019s ability to meet people where they are and offer a wide variety of programs and services to individuals right in their own neighborhoods.\nLive WoWs can be outfitted to meet the needs of the community. Common uses are for delivering outreach for public benefits, providing educational health information, and giving vaccinations.\nThe new Live WoW will have a special focus on public health. It can be used to test for communicable diseases, like Hepatitis A, dengue, and food-borne illness. It can support large-scale site investigations for tuberculosis and serve as the command-and-control vehicle for related testing.\nThe newest Live WoW also can be used for dental services, such as screenings and tooth sealants. Other potential uses include emergency public health preparedness response training. The Live WoW would also be available to respond to natural or man-made disasters.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \nSince the first Live WoW debuted in July 2021, the mobile offices have supported over 1,400 community events across the region providing more than 117,000 service interactions, including almost 16,000 COVID-19, flu, and general vaccinations.\nThe County\u2019s Live Well on Wheels mobile vehicles are dispatched by the County and made available to the community for events.\nInformation on how to request a LWoW bus is available online.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250417.13.56.51"}
