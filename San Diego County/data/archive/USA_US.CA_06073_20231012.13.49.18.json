For the 2024 edition, Newsweek also added resident satisfaction data based on National Safety Goals from The Joint Commission and Google Scores to their model.\u202f\n\u201cAt Edgemoor, we provide the highest level of care to seriously ill and injured adult patients who require long-term care,\u201d said Dr. Luke Bergmann, Director of County Behavioral Health Services (BHS). \u201cWe are proud that the hard work and commitment of our staff has been recognized as being among the best in California for five years in a row.\u201d\u202f\nUnder the umbrella of BHS, Edgemoor patients receive 24-hour skilled nursing care, physical rehabilitation, as well as recreational, occupational and speech therapy. Patients at the 192-bed facility require specialized interventions from highly trained staff.\u202f\n\u201cWe are extremely proud of this accomplishment,\u201d said Erin Chancler, Edgemoor\u2019s Administrator. \u201cIt is a reflection of the staff\u2019s dedication, commitment and hard work, as well as the support we have from the County, HHSA, and BHS leadership.\u201d\u202f\nThe Newsweek ranking adds to the growing list of national recognition Edgemoor has received for providing top-quality treatment and services. Edgemoor is a five-star facility, having received this highest rating from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for quality services.\nIn 2017, Edgemoor received the Gold Excellence in Quality Award presented by the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living. Edgemoor is currently one of only 53 skilled nursing facilities in the country to be an active recipient of the honor.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231012.13.49.18"}
