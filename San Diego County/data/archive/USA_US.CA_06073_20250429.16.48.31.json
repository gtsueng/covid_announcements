Child abuse and neglect can cause long-term psychological, emotional, and physical effects that have lasting consequences for victims.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nThe County\u2019s Child and Family Well-Being Department is focused on lowering those numbers through early intervention and family-centered programs and services. By providing support, education and easy access to critical resources, families can stay together, and children can avoid entering the child welfare service system altogether.\u202f\u00a0\nProgress is being made.\u00a0\u00a0\nChild abuse and neglect cases have decreased overall by 50 percent over the last decade while entries into foster care are down 67 percent. Both declines are a reflection of the positive impact of prevention efforts, early support and partnerships grounded in care and compassion.\u00a0\nChild abuse and neglect are preventable. If you believe a child you know is experiencing abuse or neglect, help is a phone call away. Contact the County\u2019s Child Abuse Hotline at 858-560-2191 or 800-344-6000. People also can call 2-1-1 San Diego.\u202f\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250429.16.48.31"}
