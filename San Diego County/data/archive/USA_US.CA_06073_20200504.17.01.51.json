And others are less likely to spread it to you,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., County public health officer. \u201cThe face coverings protect you, but especially those around you.\u201d\nPeople are not required to wear the face covering all the time, but anytime you come within six feet of people who are not a household contact, or when entering a business. You can carry the mask with you and put it on when approaching others, Wooten added. See more details and exceptions.\nFace coverings are now required when in public.\nCOVID-19 Testing, Cases and Deaths\nTesting:\n\n1,293 tests were reported to the County Sunday and 93 or 7% were positive.
