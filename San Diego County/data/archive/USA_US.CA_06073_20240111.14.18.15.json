These implicated oysters have only been available through restaurants and wholesale locations. The\u202fCounty Health and Human Services Agency\u202f(HHSA) has asked restaurants to set aside \u201cRocky Point oysters\u201d packed by GOLPAC located in Bahia Salina, Sonora, Mexico until further notice. Restaurants or others who purchased oysters from this location are asked to not use them while an investigation of this outbreak takes place.\u00a0\nCases to date have been tied to oysters served at three locations of The Fish Shop (Pacific Beach, Point Loma, and Encinitas) restaurants and the Carlsbad Aquafarm. Other locations may emerge during this investigation.\u00a0\nThese illnesses have been caused by norovirus, the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea among people of all ages in the United States.\u202f\u00a0\nThe 41 people who got sick reported eating raw oysters a day or two in advance of symptoms. Cases range in age from 12\u202fto\u202f83 years old.\u202fSymptoms reported included nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. None of the illnesses required hospitalization.\u202f\nSeveral household members, including children, who did not eat the oysters have subsequently become ill likely due to spread within the home.\u00a0\n\u201cThe County recommends that people ask where oysters were harvested when eating out or getting food from wholesale locations to avoid consuming Rocky Point oysters from Bahia Salina, Sonora, Mexico,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County Public Health Officer. \u201cIt\u2019s also important for anyone who is sick to seek medical care. People who are ill, and those that live with them, should wash their hands frequently to avoid contaminating surfaces and foods that could further spread the infection.\u201d\u202f\u00a0\nEating raw oysters has been linked to outbreaks with such germs as\u202fVibrio,\u202fShigella, and E. coli,\u202fin addition to norovirus. If you eat raw or undercooked oysters, germs that might be in the oyster can make you sick.\u00a0\u00a0\nPeople infected with norovirus generally develop nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever, and body aches approximately 12 to 48 hours after consuming contaminated foods. The illness typically lasts for 1-3 days. The vomiting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration requiring medical attention, especially in young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses.\u00a0\u00a0\nHHSA\u202fis working\u202fclosely with California Department of Public Health,\u202fincluding\u202fthe\u202fShellfish Program,\u202fto continue\u202finvestigating\u202fillnesses\u202fassociated with oysters.\u202f\u00a0\nPeople who have or develop symptoms should\u202freach out to\u202ftheir\u202fhealthcare\u202fprovider.\u202f To report illness to the County after dining out or purchasing from wholesale food locations call (858) 505-6814, or email fhdepi@sdcounty.ca.gov.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore information\u202fon\u202fseafood and shellfish safety\u202fis available here, general information on norovirus is here, and prevention of norovirus spread in the home information is here.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240111.14.18.15"}
