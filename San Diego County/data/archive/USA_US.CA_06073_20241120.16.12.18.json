The County worked with Affirmed Housing to demolish the old building and redevelop the site with two complexes, Alora and Estrella, offering a combined 196 affordable units.\u00a0\nEstrella broke ground in April 2023. For waitlist information please call 1-800-801-8440, Ext. 7151.\u00a0\nSince 2017, the County has invested more than $314 million into affordable housing, using excess land, its Innovative Housing Trust Fund, and other state, federal, and local funding sources administered by the County. Those funds have helped open doors to nearly 2,500 homes with 3,100 more on the way.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241120.16.12.18"}
