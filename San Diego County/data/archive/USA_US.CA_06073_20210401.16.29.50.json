That\u2019s about 2.02 million San Diegans.\nSan Diegans wishing to get vaccinated can make an appointment by visiting www.vaccinationsuperstationsd.com. Those 65 and older can call 2-1-1 for help.\nFree COVID-19 Testing at Black Churches\nFree COVID-19 testing is now available at three churches in San Diego County through June 30.\nA new partnership between the County, the\u00a0Tabernacle Community Development Corporation and the\u00a0African American Community Empowerment Council launched today to offer COVID-19 testing at Bethel AME, Bayview Baptist Church and Total Deliverance Worship Center.\nWhile vaccine distribution is now underway, community-based testing remains a key strategy to reducing coronavirus transmission and mortality. Through this partnership, COVID-19 testing will be more accessible to vulnerable communities.\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic is still a very dangerous part of our life. That remains especially true for the African American community,\u201d Wooten said at a news conference to announce the partnership. \u201cTesting is one of the most important things we can do to get back faster to the things we love.\u201d\nCounty Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten encourages San Diegans to continue getting tested for COVID-19.\nBlack churches are well-positioned to inform the community about the importance of COVID-19 testing and to provide a known, safe space for accessing testing. The goal is to test 150 people daily at each church testing location through June 30. For more information, visit www.aacec-cal.org.\nFree COVID-19 testing is also available at many locations throughout the region.

This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.\nOf those vaccinated to date, over 576,000 County residents, or 21.4% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nOverall, more than 956,000 County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That\u2019s 35.6% of those eligible.\nThose receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s vaccination dashboard.
