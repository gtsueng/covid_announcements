It proved so successful that it has already been expanded to all county detention and reentry facilities.\nThe San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department and County Library teamed up to add library cards to reentry services. The library card program hopes to help people coming home improve their lives by giving them access\u2014not just to books, but to all County Library programs, and to create \u201clifelong learners.\u201d\nFor example, they can start the path to earning a free high school diploma through the Library High School. And they can check out \u201cTech Connect\u201d Chromebook laptops, Wi-Fi hotspots and get a free year of internet service to help with job searches, education and training.\nBecause they don\u2019t need any other identification to get the library card and the access it brings, the program offers immediate hope, a sense of belonging and community.\nCounty Library officials said the program has been welcomed.\nLiz Vagani, manager of Library\u2019s Santee branch, said she talked with a man who received a reentry library card when he came to the library to pick up his \u201cTech Connect\u201d Chrome laptop.\n\u201cHe was very thankful,\u201d Vagani said. \u201cWe chatted a bit about what the library had to offer. That\u2019s when he told me he knew this would change his life.\u201d\nPosters promoting the library card program are placed in County detention facilities. People can complete the application process through their counselors. Library staff issue the card\u2014an ID packaged with a list of services and library branch locations. The packet is stored with the applicant\u2019s belongings and given to them upon release\u2014meaning every one of them can rejoin their communities with a card in hand.\nFor more information about the Sheriff\u2019s Department Reentry Services, visit the division\u2019s webpage.\nTo learn more about the San Diego County Library system, go to its website at sdcl.org.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20221115.09.59.45"}
