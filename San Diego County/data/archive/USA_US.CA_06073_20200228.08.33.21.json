They are also open on Election Day, when the voting hours will change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. to reflect the hours at the polls.\nConditional voter registration now allows residents to register to vote and vote provisionally on Election Day at any polling place. That may cause long lines and waits at polling places. The satellite voting locations and Registrar\u2019s office are better equipped to serve prospective voters and will have all ballot types in the election. The Registrar of Voters urges you to visit one of these five locations to vote early, especially if you need to register.\nIf you are registered nonpartisan, you will not have presidential candidates on your ballot. Learn the actions you need to take to vote for president.\nIf you are a mail voter but have decided to vote in person anyway, bring your mail ballot with you to turn in.\nAct now. Putting this off until Election Day will likely cause delays and long lines.\nFor more information, visit sdvote.com or call (858) 565-5800.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200228.08.33.21"}
