It looks very interesting.\u201d\nShe appreciated how a media campaign can keep the community safe.\n\u201cIt was very enlightening to know that you can do something, even if it is very little. If you can just spread the information, a lot can happen,\u201d she said.\nTo participate, students go through a now-closed application process. The no-cost program is made possible through donations from County employees and the Office of Education. Applications for next year\u2019s camp will open next April and are shared through local schools.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240715.08.03.01"}
