Lilac Road. The park was selected for active recreation because of its location. The acreage is next to Bonsall Elementary School, Bonsall Community Center, several housing developments and Highway 76.\nThe first phase of the new park will include:\n\nPlaygrounds\nShade structures with picnic tables\nMulti-use sport and soccer fields\nRestrooms\nA park office\nVolunteer host sites for added security\nParking, with two new vehicle access points to the property\nSidewalk and intersection improvements to Camino Del Rey\n\nThe active recreation site is one of two parks in the County\u2019s San Luis Rey River Park Master Plan. The Master Plan is made up of more than 1,700 acres along the San Luis Rey River between Interstate 15 and the Old Bonsall Bridge. It sets aside 95% of the San Luis Rey River Park for passive, open space uses and trails.\nBuilding this park makes progress toward the County\u2019s goal of providing 3 acres of local, public parkland for every 1,000 residents. Currently, the Bonsall community does not have any designed public parks.\nThe County\u2019s Department of Parks and Recreation gathered community input and engaged residents, businesses and other stakeholders about their needs for the park. This feedback helped to shape the design and types of features planned for this location. County staff will continue to work with the community about future phases of Bonsall Community Park.\nLast year, the County finalized a construction contract to build the first phase of Bonsall Community Park, set to open Summer 2026.
