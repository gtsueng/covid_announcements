Both cited the importance of working together to act on the region\u2019s critical housing shortage.\n\u201cWe know that housing is foundational to life, it is the most basic thing that you need in order to be able to live a fulfilled and thriving life,\u201d said County Chair Nathan Fletcher. \u201cWe also know that in San Diego County, we have some of the least affordable housing anywhere in the country.\u201d\n\u201cStable housing is the foundation of opportunity, and instability w/respect to housing has profound impacts\u2026,\u201d said Council President Sean Elo-Rivera. \u201cWe have a responsibility to make housing stable and fulfilling that responsibility will require collaboration.\u201d\nThe resolution calls for supporting four major actions:\n\nStreamlining permitting to accelerate housing production\nBuilding 10,000 affordable homes on government-owned land near transit lines, that also support climate action goals and offer construction workers good paying jobs\nLeveraging public, private and other funds to speed up the availability of affordable housing\nIncreasing density on properties owned by the San Diego Housing Commission or its nonprofit affiliate\n\nThe vote came after presentations from several organizations who also cited the critical need for housing.\nThe Global Policy Leadership Academy\u2019s Jennifer LeSar told government leaders that San Diego is noted nationally for tackling affordability but there is still more work to do. Figures showed that 81% of earned low-income households in the county are paying more than half their income on housing costs. And that puts a number of households at risk for homelessness. For those already experiencing homelessness, the Point in Time count found 8,427 people. From that total, 4,321 are sheltered but 4,106 are unsheltered.\nThe San Diego Foundation is developing a GIS mapping tool of open parcels on public land in the cities of San Diego and Chula Vista, the County and excess state lands that could be developed for affordable housing. The parcels are judged on quality of life, the ease of building housing, land use, transit and more.\nThe foundation\u2019s presentation also included details on its Housing Impact Fund and its $10 million commitment to raise an additional $90 million to address housing needs.\nThe San Diego Housing Commission has 22,000 units in service but is exploring ways to add more to the 4,120 properties it owns while keeping in mind climate goals, equity, a variety of housing types and income levels plus childcare.\n\u201cWe have a long way to go but everyone that you see here before you today is really committed to doing this work \u2026 \u00a0and working through all these challenges to make sure we see real progress,\u201d said Chair Fletcher. \u201cAs County government\u2026, we pledge the County government will be more active and more engaged than at any point in history.\u201d\nCouncil President Elo-Rivera said we must make sure the resolution is not just symbolic and called for an accountability check early next year.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20221003.15.29.54"}
