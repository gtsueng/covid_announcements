We\u2019re seeing the same trend this season, and we hope it continues,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that wearing a face covering, maintaining social distance, avoiding large crowds and taking other preventative measures are also helping to slow the spread of influenza.\u201d\nAlso, no influenza deaths have been reported this season, which began July 1 and will through June 30, 2021. In comparison, three flu-related deaths had been reported at the same time last year. A total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza last season.\nA greater number of San Diegans also are getting vaccinated this season compared to the same point last year. To date, nearly 818,660 people have gotten flu shots compared to 746,095 at the same time last year. A total of 1,234,474 people got a flu shot last season, the highest on record.\n\u201cSan Diegans are stepping up to get vaccinated against influenza and that is also a good thing,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cA flu shot helps to lower the risk of San Diegans getting influenza and the novel coronavirus at the same time and prevent the local health care system from being overwhelmed.\u201d\nThe County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.\nWhere to Get a Flu Shot\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.\nThe influenza vaccine is now available at doctors\u2019 offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County\u2019s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, sandiegocounty.gov/iz\u00a0or call 2-1-1.\n\u201cThe influenza vaccine is safe and effective,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cGet vaccinated now so that you can get protected when influenza begins to spread.\u201d\nTips to Prevent the Flu and COVID-19\nThe novel coronavirus and influenza are both spread from person to person, especially indoors and in crowded places.\nHere are some tips to help you prevent COVID-19 and the flu:\n\nWash your hands properly and regularly or use a hand sanitizer.\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, throw it away and wash your hands.\nIf you\u2019re sick, stay home and isolate yourself from others.\nUse a face covering when in public and close to others. They prevent spreading germs and viruses.\nMaintain physical distance from others.\nAvoid crowded places to decrease your risk of exposure.\n\nFor more information about influenza sandiegocounty.gov/iz.
