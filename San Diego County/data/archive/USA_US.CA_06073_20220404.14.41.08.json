Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher was the first to donate.\nThe County\u2019s blood drive is one of the largest held by the San Diego Blood Bank. More than 20 County facilities will take part this year with the overall goal of collecting 500 pints for local hospitals. The events are open to the public, as well as County employees.\nDuring its 38-year history, the County\u2019s annual blood drives have collected more than 20,000 pints of blood. Each pint can save up to three lives. The San Diego Blood Bank says over the years, the County\u2019s blood drives may have saved up to 60,000 lives.\nCurrently, there is a critical need for blood donations, and all blood types are welcome. Appointments are highly encouraged but walk-up donors will be accepted if open slots are available.\nCOVID-19 guidelines will still be in effect and all donors and staff are required to wear masks. For questions regarding deferrals or blood donations related to COVID-19, review the Blood Bank guidelines for eligibility. If you can\u2019t donate, family or friends are welcome.\nSchedule\nCounty Administration Center | BOOK NOW \n\nMON, APR 4 | 9:30 am-3:30 pm | 1600 Pacific Hwy., San Diego, CA 92101\n\nSan Diego Superior Court \u2013 South County Division | BOOK NOW\n\nTUES, APR 5 | 9 am-2:30 pm | 500 Third Ave., Chula Vista, CA 91910\n\nNorth Central Family Resource Center | BOOK NOW \n\nWED, APR 6 | 10 am-3:30 pm | parking lot, 5055 Ruffin Rd., San Diego, CA 92123\n\nEdgemoor Hospital \u2013 Santee | BOOK NOW\n\nTHUR, APR 7 | 11 am-4:30 pm | parking lot, 655 Park Center Dr., Santee, CA 92071\n\nNorth Inland Live Well Center | BOOK NOW\n\nMON, APR 11 | 10 am-3 pm | parking lot, 649 W.
