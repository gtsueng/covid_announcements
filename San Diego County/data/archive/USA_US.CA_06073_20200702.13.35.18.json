It will be open Monday to Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Advance appointments are required.\n\u201cTesting people, particularly in areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, is a critical part of our public health efforts to contain the pandemic until we have a vaccine,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cBy identifying people who are positive, we can get them into isolation, and help prevent the spread of the virus.\u201d\nCOVID-19 tests are used to evaluate your health for COVID-19 infection and help public health agencies control the virus\u2019s spread. Testing also helps identify specific areas and groups with higher rates of infection. Understanding these patterns is important to protect the public\u2019s health and continue safely reopening the County.\nTesting will be limited over the Fourth of July weekend. See schedule.
