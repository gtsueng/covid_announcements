The Harris Family Senior Residence and Mid-City Family Apartments will provide homes for over 200 low-income residents.\nThe $85 million project features 78 two- and three-bedroom units for families and 117 one-bedroom units for seniors 62 years of age and older. Qualifying households can earn no more than 40-60 percent of the average area income.\nThe County contributed more than $4 million to the project through the Innovative Housing Trust Fund. Amenities include a clubhouse with kitchen and lounge space, tot-lot play area, community garden space, BBQ area, a pet area and laundry facilities.\nAcross the region, the County of San Diego is supporting more than a dozen projects that are currently under construction. Combined, the developments will add more than 950 affordable housing units in local communities.\nThe Harris Family Senior Residence and Mid-City Family Apartments aligns with the County\u2019s Framework for Ending Homelessness, which was approved by the Board last year.\nAs part of the framework, the County has committed to investing more than $53 million to create supportive housing for persons with a serious mental illness who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20221115.08.37.04"}
