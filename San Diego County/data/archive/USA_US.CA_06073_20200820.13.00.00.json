Students were asked to create video messages specifically targeting their peers.\nThe campaign comes in response to a spike in cases in young people, particularly in the 20-29 age group. One in four lab-confirmed cases in the San Diego region are in that age group.\nThe PSA contest invited students to submit 15- to 30-second videos, in English or Spanish, that highlight the importance of frequent hand washing, social distancing and wearing face coverings. A committee of both county and SDSU staff selected the winning videos.\n\u201cWe really appreciate the creativity and continued partnership of SDSU\u2019s School of Public Health as we collectively address the ongoing threat of the novel coronavirus,\u201d said Nick Macchione, director of the County\u2019s Health and Human Services Agency and lead of T-3, the county\u2019s program to expand COVID-19 testing, tracing and treatment throughout the region. \u201cThe videos I watched clearly and effectively delivered all the right messages to our youth population.\u201d\nThe county has a longstanding partnership with SDSU and the university is one of the county\u2019s Live Well San Diego partners. As such, the university has adopted the county\u2019s vision for a region that is healthy, safe and thriving.\n\u201cThis contest was an opportunity to support the county\u2019s effort to reach youth through peer to peer messaging,\u201d said Hala Madanat, director of the SDSU School of Public Health and lead organizer of the contest. \u201cSDSU students rose to the occasion producing outstanding videos that send a clear message about the importance of social distancing, wearing face coverings, and hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I am so proud of our students.\u201d\nBoth the county and SDSU will use the winning videos on social media to promote the importance of following public health guidelines.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200820.13.00.00"}
