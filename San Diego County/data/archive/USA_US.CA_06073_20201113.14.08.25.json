The reason is that people in this age bracket tend to have had chronic cardiovascular disease, which itself could have resulted from long-time methamphetamine abuse.\nThe 2020 Meth Report Card also shows:\n\nThere were 13,020 emergency room visits due to methamphetamines in 2018 compared to 12,926 in 2017. Data from 2019 won\u2019t be available until 2021.\nA total of 6,591 people were admitted to County-funded treatment programs due to meth abuse last year, vs. 6,906 in 2018.\n59% of adult arrestees tested positive for meth in 2019, compared to 57% the previous year.\n11% of juvenile arrestees tested positive for meth in 2019, compared to 10% in 2018.\nMeth arrests for selling and possession of meth increased to 11,313 in 2019 vs. 10,156 the year before.\n\nMost Meth Coming from Mexico\nSan Diego County has had a long history with meth and the problems that come along with it. While the region is no longer considered the \u201cMeth Capital of the World,\u201d and little meth is produced locally, there is more meth available, and it is more potent and cheaper than ever.\nThe highly addictive and deadly drug is being manufactured and smuggled across the border by Mexican drug cartels. Today, most of the methamphetamine in San Diego County is coming from Mexico.\nAccording to the Drug Enforcement Administration, methamphetamine seizures at U.S.-Mexico ports of entry nearly doubled in 2019. More than 34,000 kilograms were seized in 2019 compared to more than 19,000 kilograms the year before.\nWith availability going up and prices coming down, meth is having more negative consequences in San Diego families and communities.\nTreatment is Available\nThe County funds residential and outpatient treatment programs across the region to help people recover from substance use disorders. Participation in a recovery program also improves overall health.\nPeople who want to anonymously report meth or drug activity are encouraged to call the Meth Hotline at (877) NO-2-METH or visit\u00a0www.no2meth.org. Substance use treatment resources are available by calling the County\u2019s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 or 2-1-1.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20201113.14.08.25"}
