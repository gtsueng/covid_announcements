These fires caused an annual average of 1 civilian death, 26 civilian injuries, and $13 million in direct property damage.\u202f\u00a0\nThe San Diego County Fire Protection District offers the following safety guidance:\u00a0\n1.) Keep your\u00a0tree at least 3 feet from a furnace, fireplace or portable heater.\u00a0\nKeep cut trees watered to prevent drying out quickly.\u00a0A dry tree can burn\u00a0in less than a minute.\u00a0This\u00a0video by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission illustrates how a dry tree can go up in flames in about 30 seconds.\n\nAfter Christmas, put the tree out promptly for proper disposal or recycling to reduce the risk for fire.\u00a0\n2.) Prevent electrical fires\u00a0by\u00a0ensuring you buy holiday lights that have been tested for safety by an independent laboratory. Check for a label.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFollow directions for safety. Don\u2019t hang indoor lights outside\u00a0or vice versa.\u00a0\u00a0\nDon\u2019t plug\u00a0too many\u00a0items into an electrical socket\u00a0or extension cord.\u00a0\u00a0\nDon\u2019t string together more than 3 strands of lights.\u00a0\nInspect your lights and don\u2019t use damaged ones. If you do buy new lights,\u00a0LED lights are\u00a0more fire safe.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t connect LED lights and non-LED light strands.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnplug lights and your tree at night before\u00a0leaving the house or\u00a0going to bed.\u00a0\u00a0\nTry to buy\u00a0and\u00a0use flame resistant\u00a0or flame retardant\u00a0decorations especially when placed near lights or heat sources.\u00a0\n\n3.) Have your chimney inspected at least once a year to check for its soundness as well as hazardous deposits or other blockages that could cause a chimney fire. \n\nNever use excessive paper or flammable liquid to start a fire. \nUse a metal or glass screen to keep embers in the fireplace opening.\nNever leave a fire unattended or burning overnight.\u00a0\n\n4.) Never put electric heaters near flammable items like curtains or fabrics, dry trees or garland, or decorations. \n\nNever plug into an extension cord or overloaded electrical outlet. \nIf using or buying a portable heater,\u00a0make sure it\u2019s a good quality model that has been professionally tested for safety. \nNever leave it on overnight.\u00a0\n\n5.) Candles should only be placed\u00a0on sturdy surfaces\u00a0away from curtains or fabrics\u00a0or where pets or children can\u00a0reach them.\u00a0\n\nPeople should also use stable candleholders.\u00a0\nNever leave\u00a0lit candles\u00a0unattended.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211210.14.13.13"}
