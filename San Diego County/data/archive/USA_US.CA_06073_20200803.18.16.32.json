A second County trigger resulted in the hiring of more case investigators and a third, related to outbreaks, continues to be elevated.\nToday, County health officials announced the case rate has been steadily dropping. After reaching a high of 158.5 on July 23, the rate for the region has declined to 118.2.\n\u201cThe results over the past seven days are promising and are due to everyone doing their part to change this metric,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cSo, keep up the great work, San Diego.\u201d\nFor the County to be off the state\u2019s watchlist, it would have to report 240 cases or fewer for 14 days in a row.\nAnother trigger that has been improving is the seven-day average percentage of case investigations initiated within 24 hours after a positive case is assigned. After reaching a low of 7% July 18, the percentage has dramatically increased in the past few days and is now at 48%, after the County added more than 200 case investigators. More case investigators will be coming onboard in the days and weeks to come.\nThis investigation metric, Wooten said, is likely to be normal in the next week or two.\n\u201cWe\u2019re adding new staff, and this is helping to improve this particular metric,\u201d Wooten said.\nThe third trigger that has been consistently in the red and is trending in the wrong direction is the number of COVID-19 outbreaks in a community setting over a seven-day period.\nOver the past seven days, 39 community outbreaks have been confirmed, the highest seven-day total since the pandemic began. Fifteen of the 39 outbreaks were reported in restaurant/bar settings, seven in businesses, four in restaurants without bars and the rest in other settings.\nCounty Opens Testing Site in Pacific Beach\nThe County is opening a COVID-19 testing site in Pacific Beach due to the increasing number of cases in the area.\nThe drive-up site will offer free testing Tuesdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Pacific Beach/Taylor Branch Library, located at 4275 Cass Street in San Diego.\nAppointments are required and can be made five days in advance. They can be made online at www.211sandiego.org or by calling 2-1-1.

Target is less than\u00a08.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 7,454.\n\nCases:\n\n343 new cases were reported in San Diego County for a total of 30,226.\n2,599 or 8.6% of cases have required hospitalization.\n656 or 2.2% of all cases and 25.2% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nNo new\u00a0COVID-19 deaths were reported in San Diego County on Aug. 2 and the region\u2019s total remains at 565.\n\nMore Information:\nMore information on COVID-19 and detailed data summaries can be found at the County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200803.18.16.32"}
