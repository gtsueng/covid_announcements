If someone shows these signs, call 9-1-1 and begin cooling the individual by moving them to shade, spraying them with cool water and fanning, placing them in a cool shower if they are alert, monitoring their body temperatures, continue cooling efforts and NOT giving them fluids to drink.\nHere are some tips to help people avoid heat-related problems:\n\nStay in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day. Even a few hours spent in air conditioning can help your body stay cooler. Do not rely on electric fans for cooling if temperatures exceed 90 degrees.\nWear light, loose-fitting clothing.\nDrink plenty of water (avoid alcohol and sugary drinks) and don\u2019t wait until you are thirsty.\nTake cool showers.\nNever\u00a0leave a child, elderly person, or pet unattended in a car.\nKeeping\u00a0pets cool in hot weather.\nAvoid unnecessary hard work or activities outside during the hottest part of the day.\nAvoid unnecessary sun exposure and wear a wide-brim hat if you need to be in the sun.\nAvoid using the oven to cook.\n\nPet safety tips:\n\nKeep your pets indoors if the temperature is lower inside.\nExercise pets in early morning hours or early evening to avoid prolonged exposure to the heat. Avoid strenuous runs or hikes.\nKeep your pets\u2019 water supply in a tip-proof container, always topped off, and be sure it stays cool (pets will not drink water that is too hot).\nConsider a misting system to keep the outdoor areas cooler.\nBe sure your pet has shade ALL DAY, if they are outside. Remember, the sun\u2019s position changes during the day.\nDo not take your pets for car trips unless absolutely necessary. A car can heat up very quickly. On an 85-degree day, a car can reach 102 degrees in 10 minutes and soar upward even with the windows down an inch or two.\nDon\u2019t take your dogs for walks on the hot pavement. If it is too hot for you to walk barefooted, then don\u2019t make your dogs do it either.\nConsider adding a child\u2019s wading pool for your dog. Many dogs will keep cool by \u201ctaking a dip.\u201d\n\nA\u00a0complete list and map of County Cool Zone sites, their hours and locations are located online.
