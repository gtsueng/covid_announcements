It includes drop-down guides to help people figure out what County department might have the records they\u2019re looking for. It has easy-to-use links to other County data portals. It has search-prompts to make looking for records easier. It has a list of frequently asked questions. And it has a how-to video in the frequently-asked-questions link showing\u2014step-by-step\u2014how to request the public records you seek.\nThe new Public Records Request Center is part of the County Clerk of the Board of Supervisors office. It was created to meet the County Board of Supervisors transparency initiatives and centralize public records requests in the clerk\u2019s office. It will make requesting public records simpler because all requests will be handled through the center or the data portals on it.\nOne of the cool new features is the websites\u2019 \u201cView Existing Public Records Act Requests\u201d tool. Clicking on that link will allow anyone to see the public records that others have asked for, starting with record requests made on or after March 21. When someone requests a public record, the County will automatically make the information available to the general public three days after the request is completed.\nCalifornia\u2019s Public Records Act was established in 1968. It declared that \u201caccess to information concerning the conduct of the people\u2019s business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.\u201d\nUsing the new website is easy.\nGetting Started\n\nGo to the County Public Record Act website.\nClick on \u201cMake a Request\u201d and start by entering a description of the records/information\u2014as detailed as possible\u2014that you\u2019re looking for.\nAs you are typing in your information, you may see yellow boxes appear.\nThe boxes may tell you to visit another website or resource. If so, please do that first.\nThey may also recommend adding a County department in the drop-down box that would be the best to handle your request. Add the department or departments you think can best help find the records you seek. You can also leave the department selection blank.\n\nAdd Your Contact Info\n\nWhen you finish describing the records you want, you should fill in your contact information\u2014name, email address, address and phone. Do NOT include personal, confidential information such as your Social Security number or birthdate.\nIf you don\u2019t add a valid email address, the County won\u2019t be able to directly respond to you with the information you seek. You can submit a public records act request on the site anonymously and get the information you\u2019re looking for. That\u2019s because three days after a public records act request is closed, even if it was sent anonymously, the County will release the information to the general public. You can look for it with the \u201cView Existing Public Records Act Requests\u201d tool.\nHowever, adding your email allows the County to directly send you the information you\u2019re looking for.\n\nCreating an Account\n\nWhen you add your email address to your request, the website will prompt you to set up an account using a username and password.\nThis offers additional benefits. When you create an account, you can attach files to your request if you\u2019d like. Having the account also allows County staff to ask follow-up questions to ensure they know exactly what you\u2019re looking for.\nHaving an account will also allow you to check on the status and progress of your request. And it will allow you to download documents you\u2019re looking for.\n\nSo, there you have it. Getting the information you want about County government has never been easier.\nFor more information about public records and the online Public Records Request Center, contact the County Clerk of the Board of Supervisors Public Records Act unit at COBrecords@sdcounty.ca.gov.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240321.11.09.51"}
