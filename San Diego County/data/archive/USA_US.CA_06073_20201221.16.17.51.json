The training and qualification process to become a shelter worker, which now includes a specific pandemic section, is constantly being updated to ensure the highest quality of service for County residents.\nToney also said most of the county\u2019s qualified shelter workers and managers come from departments outside of OES. The training teaches them how to recognize needs, take action, and ensure county residents are living safely with increased preparedness and response capabilities provided by OES.\n\u201cI became involved with the shelter team program during the 2003 wildfires in San Diego and have assisted with several County-established local assistance centers since then,\u201d said Luis Ochoa, a supervising child support officer with the county\u2019s Department of Child Support Services. \u201cI don\u2019t like to see anyone suffer, especially those stricken by disaster and I feel a strong desire to assist in any way I can.\u201d\nOchoa said he has previously worked in several roles as part of the program, including as an intake coordinator, interpreter and runner. In 2018 he was trained as an assistant local assistance center manager, and in the recent Valley Fire in September he was asked to take on the lead role as center manager.\nOES encourages all families in the county to have an\u00a0emergency plan and practice it so it is familiar in a high-stress situation. Additionally, all County residents are encouraged to register their cellphones on\u00a0AlertSanDiego, the County\u2019s emergency notification system and download the\u00a0SD Emergency App\u00a0at no cost. An\u00a0emergency family plan template\u00a0is available in English, Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Japanese, Arabic, traditional and simplified Chinese, Farsi, French, Korean, Somali and in an audio version.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20201221.16.17.51"}
