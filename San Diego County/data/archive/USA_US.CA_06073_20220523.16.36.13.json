The Investing Learn to Earn Virtual Event was created and implemented when many employees were working remotely due to the pandemic and was a way to provide information that can seem too complex to some and hinder financial wellness.\nThe County received the awards in 15 categories. More than a dozen are programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to support the region\u2019s workforce, employers, renters, and public health providers, systems and scientists. Other programs streamlined County processes to benefit users, supported youth and families, protected the environment including agriculture, addressed housing insecurity and emergency preparedness.\nBelow is the full list of programs honored:\nBest in Category (Employment and Training): \n\nInvesting Learn to Earn Virtual Event \u2013 Treasurer Tax Collector\n\nChildren and Youth
