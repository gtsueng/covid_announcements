It is now in its third round of funding.\nThe County is partnering with the San Diego Housing Commission and the City of San Diego to apply for the Homekey funding to buy and rehabilitate housing focusing on four development projects.\nThe County\u2019s $32 million would come from $24.5 million in federal American Rescue Act Plan funds and $7.5 million from the County\u2019s Behavioral Health Impact Fund.\nThe City of San Diego would also contribute $32 million; the Housing Commission will add 320 project-based housing assistance vouchers valued at over $68 million.\nThe County\u2019s Health and Human Services Agency would use the $4.6 million annual funding to provide behavioral health and other services to support new tenants.\n\u201cThis partnership coupled with the available Homekey funding can provide permanent housing and crucial supportive services to an estimated 325 to 500 San Diegans in need,\u201d said David Estrella, Director of the County\u2019s Housing and Community Development Services. \u201cToday\u2019s action paves the way to ensure valuable State resources are brought home for the most vulnerable residents in our community.\u201d\nLocal governments that are eligible to use the Homekey money include cities, counties and other local public agencies that can apply with for-profit and nonprofit developers.\nIn 2022, the County, City of San Diego, San Diego Housing Commission and PATH ventures were awarded $11.8 million in Homekey funds to build a 41-unit development that is currently under construction.\nThe County\u2019s reserved capital and supportive services funding is contingent on the completion of due diligence and Homekey funding awards.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230523.16.36.36"}
