Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cDon\u2019t let flu, COVID-19, or other winter illnesses spoil your family reunions this holiday season.\u201d\nCOVID-19 and flu vaccines are widely available across the region at pharmacies, medical centers and clinics. The two vaccines can be administered during the same visit. It is important to note that the COVID-19 primary vaccine series or booster does not protect against the flu and the flu vaccine does not protect people against COVID-19. Therefore, it is recommended that eligible San Diegans get vaccinated against both viruses.\nCOVID-19 Vaccination Progress:\n\nClose to 2.69 million or 80.4% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.\nBoosters administered: 1,500,106 or 60.2 % of 2,492,580 eligible San Diegans.\nMore vaccination information can be found at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.\n\nCOVID-19 Deaths:\n\nFive additional deaths were reported since the last report on Nov. 17, 2022.

The region\u2019s total is now 938,321.\nThe 3,034 cases reported in the past week were higher compared to the 2,193 infections identified the previous week (Nov. 7 to Nov. 13, 2022).\n5,012 tests were reported to the County on Nov. 19, and the percentage of new positive cases was 6.6 (Data through Nov. 19).\nThe 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Nov. 19, is 5.3%.\n\nInfluenza Activity\nThe County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the\u00a0Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report\u00a0weekly.

They died between Nov. 8, 2022 and Nov. 14, 2022.\nOne had received a flu shot this season and two had not.\nAll had underlying medical conditions and none of the newly-reported deaths were coinfected with COVID-19.\nEmergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 10% of all visits (compared with 10% the previous week).\nLab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 2,353 (compared to 2,387 the previous week).\nTotal lab-confirmed cases to date: 10,231 (compared to 357 at the same time last season and a 381 prior 5-year average during the same week).\n\nMore Information:\nData updates to the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0will be published Thursdays around 5 p.m., with the exception of holidays.
