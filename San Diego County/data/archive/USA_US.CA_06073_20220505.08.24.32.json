It would add significant investments and just over 1,000 staff across priority areas. The budget also maintains essential public safety, land use, health and social services.\nThe total recommended budget is 1.1% smaller than the budget the County Board of Supervisors approved last year, mainly because many one-time costs for COVID-19 response are no longer needed.\nThe County Board of Supervisors must approve a new budget by June 30 and County leaders are urging the public to take part in the approval process. The board will get an overview of the budget during presentations by County departments at public meetings May 19 and 20. The public can comment in person or by phone at two budget hearings in June: a daytime hearing June 13, and an evening session June 16. People can also comment online through e-comment until budget hearings close. See more information on how to comment at Board of Supervisors meetings.\nIn addition, the public can attend virtual community budget meetings for each Board of Supervisors district (find your district):\n\nMay 23: District 3\nMay 31: District 4\nJune 2: District 1\nJune 6: District 5\nJune 8: District 2\n\nThe recommended budget makes investments in these key areas:\nMental Health and Substance Use Support\nThe new budget recommends adding $71.8 million and 115 new positions to help continue County efforts to transform its behavioral health system, from one of crisis response to prevention, continuous care and everyday health care to keep people connected and healthy.\nThe budget will continue to improve services to help people with mental health challenges and substance use disorders, focusing on those who have historically suffered silently, including people experiencing homelessness and youth.\nFunds will support Mobile Crisis Response Teams, made up of mental health experts rather than law enforcement, to respond to someone in crisis.\nThe budget also includes a wide variety of resources to match the right type of care with the person in need \u2013 things such as recuperative care, school-based services, services for foster youth, people in long-term care services and the LGBTQ community.\nHomelessness and Housing\nMental health and substance use support are combined with investments in innovative housing solutions to make significant progress in ending homelessness.\nIncreased investments in the new recommended budget include $11.9 million from one-time stimulus funds to develop affordable housing to reduce homelessness.\nAnother $10 million increase would be spent to help people experiencing homelessness regionwide by working with cities to buy shelters and places for people to stay. One recent partnership with the Lucky Duck Foundation and the City of San Diego will result in a 150-bed emergency shelter opening this summer.\nAdditional efforts to create more affordable housing for residents include $3 million to waive permit fees to encourage building accessory dwelling units. Another $810,000 will create an inclusionary zoning ordinance, which will require new development to include housing that people at or below median income levels can afford.\nJustice Reform\nThe County\u2019s justice system continues to move toward prevention, rehabilitation and training to help people avoid justice involvement and successfully come back to our communities following time in custody. This includes the Alternatives to Incarceration initiative. The initiative supports alternatives to jail and provides services and care, including mental health and sobering services, for people who don\u2019t pose a public safety threat.\nMore than $130 million is invested in health care services in the County\u2019s jails to help offenders.\nRoughly $6.2 million will be spent on a Youth Development Academy to help young people who have committed serious offenses by giving them more intensive, longer-term behavioral health, rehabilitative and skill-building services to help them come back to our communities.\nCounty Probation will use $1 million toward de-escalation training for their staff, supporting the young people they supervise.\nThe Juvenile Diversion Initiative and Transitional Age Youth Diversion program in the District Attorney\u2019s office will be bolstered with $2.4 million, to give juveniles the opportunity to accept services and counseling instead of prosecution.\nThe Public Defender\u2019s Office will add $21.8 million and 90 staff to defend clients, represent immigrants and the indigent in our neighborhoods, and improve transitions back into communities.\nThe District Attorney will use $3.5 million and add 18 positions to expand services to victims of crime, including the South Bay Center for Community Resiliency and Trauma Recovery, and a resentencing program.\nEquity and Access\nThe new budget also continues efforts to weave equity into all County programs and services.\nThe County Office of Equity and Racial Justice has implemented its new Budget Equity Assessment Tool that helps County departments prioritize services and allocations with equity in mind. The tool uses a series of questions to better understand how allocations affect historically marginalized vulnerable communities, those who are low-income or those who have historically and currently suffer from inequality.\nThe tool also incorporates community engagement, an important cornerstone of the County\u2019s operations that will be expanded in this budget to provide opportunities for all community members to play meaningful roles in discussions and decision-making.\nIncreased translation and interpretation services will provide greater access to services and information.\nA new Office of Sustainability and Environmental Justice will be funded with $3.5 million and work to make sure all communities have the same protection from health hazards.\nAnd the San Diego County Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement will serve as the central location for education and resources for employers and their workers; it will undertake research and data analysis regarding worker issues, and pursue enforcement measures to protect workers.\nSustainability and Fighting Climate Change\nClimate change is already affecting San Diego County communities and the County is working hard to address the issue through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing sustainability.\nMore than $25 million will be invested to cut greenhouse gas emissions in our unincorporated communities, including $1 million to support electric vehicle charging stations.\nNearly $60 million will be spent on other environmental improvements, including $40 million to address stormwater issues, $16.3 million on the Multiple Species Conservation Program and $3.4 million to improve the Tijuana River Valley.\nGreen building and solar energy will be promoted by waiving an estimated $2.1 million in permit fees. More than 3,500 trees intended to trap more than 178,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year will be planted around the county.\nGreenhouse gas emissions will be reduced \u2014 while equitable access to health care is boosted \u2014 by allocating $2 million to buy two additional Live Well on Wheels vehicles and a new mobile public health lab that can bring services to residents rather than requiring them to travel individually to health offices.\nSupporting Families \nThis budget also includes additional funding and positions to focus on the day-to-day needs of residents at home and at work, especially the most vulnerable.\nIn-Home Supportive Services for older adults and people who are blind or disabled will be boosted by 60 positions. Another 100 new positions will bolster essential services including CalFresh and Medi-Cal, to help people get the food and health care they need. Child Welfare Services will also add 100 new positions to increase emergency response support, and quality placement for children in care, to strengthen prevention services and continue improving connecting families to community-based services.\nMore than $30 million received through the America Rescue Plan Act of 2021 will continue to support the Board of Supervisors\u2019 framework for using the funds, including mental health services for young people and support for renters and nutrition programs.\nThe County\u2019s new Office of Economic Development & Government Affairs will foster inclusive economic growth, provide opportunities in arts and culture, and administer grant programs that focus on nonprofits and community-based organizations.\nAnd the County\u2019s new Office of Evaluation, Performance and Analytics will use data and analytics to better inform decisions that impact our communities and improve service delivery.\nEnhancing Communities and Keeping Them Safe\nThe budget also invests in safety and quality of life.\nThis includes $2.9 million for land for a future public safety facility located at Interstate 15 and State Route 76, and $250,000 to start plans and design for a new Jacumba fire station.\nIn addition, the San Diego County Fire Protection District is adding $2.2 million to protect communities and reduce community wildfire risk in unincorporated areas through roadside vegetation management and creating fire breaks.\nPublic Health Services will add 71 new positions to continue to strengthen its overall ability to protect our residents\u2019 health.\nThe budget would spend $550,000 for new and expanded County parks, including Calavo, Star Ranch, Lindo Lake, Park Circle and the Waterfront Park. And a Food Access Initiative to help create community gardens will be funded with $1 million.\nGet Involved in the Budget Process \nTo find out more about the recommended budget and upcoming meetings and hearings, visit\u00a0budget.sandiegocounty.gov.
