Roshan volunteered in classrooms for students with special needs. He noticed students with communication needs were not allowed to take their school issued communication devices (tablets, iPads, PCs) with them after high school graduation which meant they were left with no way to communicate online. Communication devices with an app can cost almost $1,000 and many families cannot afford the expense. Roshan created VoicesGo.Org, a website helping families understand the avenues available to fund and secure a device. VoicesGo has helped students obtain devices so they can participate in society, register to vote, gain employment, and interact with family and peers. The problem of leaving a public school district without a communication device affects thousands of students across California. Roshan drafted a bill for the California State Legislature which would cost taxpayers nothing but would enable students with disabilities to procure a device before leaving public school.\nElla Kim\nElla Kim, 15, Francis Parker School junior, won the award for Writing. As a Korean American, Ella is motivated to give voice to those whose silent struggles and difficulties she can understand. Ella believes the simple act of seeing oneself reflected in the world, in any way, is inexplicably powerful, whether through music, writing or other mediums, and it is through both her stories and her actions that Ella wants to bring that vision to those around her. Ella explains that when she was young, she never saw books that explained her culture or her history and later felt like she grew up missing that part of herself. Ella intends to address that deficiency through her Girl Scout Gold Award project by creating an illustrated children\u2019s book focused on the topic of Korean history. Ella also created Parker\u2019s Writer\u2019s Circle, is a member of the school robotics team and a founding member of the National History Society Project, head of publicity on the Parker Community Engagement Board and co-head of writing for the Culture of San Diego Club.\nAlurah Chappel\nAlurah Chappell,17, San Pasqual Academy senior, received an award for Courage to Overcome: Family Situation.

Alurah grew up poor and in a bad neighborhood with gunshots firing every night. Family life was tumultuous, her father volatile, her brothers disinterested in school or learning. Alurah says being away from family allows her to understand what she wants from life and gives her the freedom to make her own decisions. On the other hand, being away from her parents means she must handle problems on her own without anyone to \u201csave\u201d her. Alurah has maintained a 4.0 GPA and received 10 awards in academic excellence. She has also played five different sports.\nMakena Stumpo\nMakena Stumpo, 13, is an 8th grade student at Pacific Beach Middle School. He won an award for Performing Arts: Music.

In her freshman year, her family moved to the U.S. and Leslie found a sense of community at Crawford that she had never experienced before. She became president of the Gay Student Alliance (GSA) and spent hours researching LGBTQ history to educate and engage GSA members, and to spread information through crafting presentations, Jeopardy games, a Kahoot about pride flags and other creative events.
