Remember, it takes longer to stop when roads are wet. Allow yourself at least an extra 15 minutes or so to arrive at your destination to adjust for slower traffic.\nTurn on your headlights to see better and make it easier for other drivers to see you. It\u2019s the law.\nTry to drive toward the middle lanes as water tends to gather in outside lanes.\nDefog your windows for better visibility. Rain can cause windows to fog up. Along the same lines, check your windshield wipers preferably before it rains again and replace them as needed.\nAvoid driving through deep water because it can affect your brakes. If you cannot avoid it, test your brakes afterward to make sure they\u2019ve dried out and are working properly.\nGive the cars in front of you extra distance. The spray from their vehicles \u2014 particularly from larger trucks and buses \u2014 can hamper your vision. And giving extra space to the guy in front of you also gives you more time to brake or adjust if you need to.\nKeep calm, don\u2019t oversteer or stomp on the breaks if you start to hydroplane or skid when your tires lose traction with the wet road. The Department of Motor Vehicles says keep the steering wheel straight and take your foot off the accelerator so your vehicle can slow down slowly.\nTurn around, don\u2019t drown. In heavy rains, never drive through a flooded roadway if you cannot see the pavement. Even a few inches of water running at the right velocity can sweep a car, and even a truck, and its occupants off the roadway and downstream. The same tip applies to trying to walk or swim across a flooded roadway.\nStay focused. Remember, it\u2019s illegal, and dangerous, to try to text or use a hand-held cell phone when you\u2019re driving.\nSlow down for the cone zone if you see highway or road workers ahead or to your side. Watch out for DPW crews and equipment.\n\nBonus tip, if you have to travel to where you\u2019ll have to drive in snow, keep up with the weather reports to see if tire chains are required. Be aware conditions on the ground can change rapidly. Also keep some extra safety equipment in your car.\nChain controls, road condition updates, and other safety advisories are posted on DPW\u2019s\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Twitter\u00a0sites.\nOff the roads, while this storm system is not expected to be excessive, residents may want to prepare and learn more about flood risks since floods are the most common natural disaster. The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services has flood ready information to lessen your risk.\nDPW\u2019s road division crews keep roads and motorists safe by removing road hazards, closing flooded roadways and plowing roads when bad weather strikes.\nThe Office of Emergency Services helps residents prepare for disasters and emergencies by encouraging people to create a personal disaster plan, register for emergency updates and download the free SDEmergency app.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230109.18.05.57"}
