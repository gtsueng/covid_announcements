The Free 4 Menstrual Equity, or Free4ME program, intends to address period poverty, a person\u2019s inability to access or pay for menstrual products.\nAs part of the pilot program, the County recently partnered with Aunt Flow to install 57 free menstrual product dispensers in 23 County-owned facilities\u00a0across\u00a0the region. The facilities\u00a0include\u00a0libraries, Family Resource Centers and Community Centers.\n\u201cAs a longtime healthcare and reproductive justice advocate, I am proud the County of San Diego has not just heard this call\u202fbut is the first known county government in the nation to\u202ftake concrete action to support the menstrual equity movement,\u201d said Board of Supervisors Vice Chair Nora Vargas. \u201cPeriod poverty disproportionately\u202fimpacts people experiencing homelessness, transgender people, youth and low-income individuals, and has only been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\nStudies show that nearly\u202ftwo-thirds of\u00a0low-income people with periods in the U.S. have been unable to afford menstruation products during the previous year, and frequently must decide between purchasing food or other necessities and menstrual hygiene products.\nThe issue disproportionately affects school-aged individuals, with one recent study showing that one in five youths have missed school because they didn\u2019t have access to menstrual products during their period.\n\u201cIt is important that people who menstruate have access to menstrual health products,\u201d said Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer.\u00a0\u201cThey should be provided in our restrooms just as we provide toilet paper and paper towels.\u201d\nFood stamps and WIC do not cover the purchase of menstrual products, forcing many individuals to ration sanitary products by using them for extended amounts of time, or using unsanitary items to manage their periods.\n\u201cMenstrual equity is a public health issue because individuals who do not have access to menstrual products are at a greater risk for infections that can make them more susceptible to infertility,\u201d said Kelly Motadel, M.D., M.P.H., County child health officer. \u201cThe fact that these issues primarily affect vulnerable communities, especially along income lines, should move and motivate progress towards achieving menstrual equity.\u201d\nThe Free4ME initiative was sparked by local community leaders\u00a0including\u00a0Youth Will\u00a0and Planned Parenthood. Both organizations provided critical input into the development and evaluation of the program.\nThe County\u2019s vendor for the menstrual product dispensers, Aunt Flow, is a leader in the menstrual equity movement. The company stocks its dispensers with 100% organic cotton products, which contributes to the County\u2019s commitment to sustainability.\nThe long-term goal of\u00a0Free4ME\u00a0is to install free\u00a0menstrual\u00a0product dispensers in all\u00a0public-facing\u00a0County\u00a0facilities.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210528.11.02.20"}
