Warning signs will tell beachgoers that beach water may contain sewage and may cause illness if people come into contact with it. With transboundary south swell conditions expected this Fourth of July weekend, warning signs may be posted at South County beaches.\nHere are the category differences:\nAdvisory Category\nAn advisory sign is posted for awareness for beachgoers when test results exceed State health standards, but no known sewage conditions exist, and water is not moving from south to north. When an advisory is posted, it means people have a higher chance of getting sick based on testing levels of contaminated water.\nNew Warning Category\nA warning sign will be posted for beachgoers when testing exceeds State health standards AND south swell (transboundary flow) ocean\u00a0conditions are pushing waters from the south to the north. A warning indicates that even though sewage impacts are not verified, sewage may be in the water due to the south swell\u00a0 conditions. Warnings will help people make their own decisions about whether to enter recreational waters. Previously, test results and a south swell would have resulted in a beach closure.\nClosure Category\nBeach closures are issued if there are\u00a0known sewage impacts.\u00a0This means it is known for sure there is sewage in the water, and to protect the public\u2019s health, State law requires the closure of affected beaches. Closures follow reported sewage spills, or when the Tijuana River is flowing and reaching recreational waters, or when County environmental health experts verify sewage odors or water discoloration reported by lifeguards, beach managers, and/or surfers/swimmers.\nThe new warning category will be implemented through the end of September\u00a0to evaluate how well it serves the public and our communities.\nNo Signs\nNo signs posted? No need to worry, just enjoy the beach!\u00a0\nCounty officials encourage residents and visitors to learn more about water quality conditions and risks by using the QR code on posted beach signs or by visiting sdbeachinfo.com for more information.\nIn May, the County became the first coastal county in the United States to start using rapid, DNA-based water quality testing technology (ddPCR) that produces faster results.\u00a0 This technique came after nearly 10 years of testing, pilot programs, and working with federal, state and local agencies.\nYou can learn more about each of these beach water quality management categories on DEHQ\u2019s popular \u201cCheck in Before You Get In\u201d website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220629.09.19.56"}
