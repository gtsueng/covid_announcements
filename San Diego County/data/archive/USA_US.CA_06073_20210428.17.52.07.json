Each ADA-accessible yurt site has a picnic table, fire ring and a parking spot, with the option to add a second car. Primitive campsites do not offer hookups, power or water at each site.\nThe campground also has an amphitheater, a nature education center and nature play equipment made of natural objects for children, and restrooms and showers.\nThe campsite is taking reservations for the regular sites and yurts will be available starting this weekend. Camping can be booked for $24 for tent, equestrian and multi-use sites, plus a $5 reservation fee. Reservation fees for the yurts are $60 for the smaller ones and $90 for the larger ones.\nThe Greg Cox Bike Park is the second bike skills park the County has built and it will be operated by the city of Chula Vista from 8 a.m. to sunset. The County\u2019s first bike park, the popular Sweetwater Bike Park, opened to rave reviews in January 2020. Like Sweetwater, the Greg Cox Bike Park was built to create exercise and fun for riders of all ages and is free for users. The 3.2-acre, $1.05 million park located just beyond 253 Rancho Drive features beginner and intermediate bike trails, a beginner\u2019s zone, a jump line and what County officials say is California\u2019s largest modular pump track \u2014 a bicycle course of rollers, banked turns and other features that let bikers ride without pedaling.\nCox was thanked at the opening ceremony for his efforts and said he was \u201chonored with the recognition and the naming,\u201d but said it\u2019s been a collaborative effort among three jurisdictions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to bring a lot of kids out and give them the skills they need to get outside and get some exercise and become healthier,\u201d said Cox. \u201cSo, it\u2019s a real joy to see and it\u2019s even more exciting to see the kids out here \u2013 and adults, using this facility.\u201d\nThe bike park was immediately opened to the public at the end of Wednesday\u2019s ribbon-cutting, which was performed by riders bicycling through a large ceremonial ribbon.\n\u201cBoth of these projects have been a labor of love for County Parks,\u201d said Brian Albright, director for the County of San Diego Department of Parks and Recreation. \u201cResearch shows that spending time outdoors and in nature is good for you. We hope our parks will inspire more people to be active and build social connections \u2013 two things that seem especially vital, given the past year, for our physical, emotional and mental well-being.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210428.17.52.07"}
