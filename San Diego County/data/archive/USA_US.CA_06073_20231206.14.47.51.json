The community asked for access to nature, playgrounds, mountain biking and restrooms, which is part of the park design.\nThe park will consist of 25 acres for organized activities and 73 acres will be open to the public and used as an open space nature preserve.\nAccess to the park will be along the northern part of South Grade Road next to the County property. The park was also designed to reduce noise, traffic, wildlife and safety risks and have a view with few obstructions.\nThis was in response to community feedback from over a dozen stakeholder meetings with Alpine community groups.\nThe park involves two phases of construction. Phase one is on the northern part of the park. Valued at $11.4 million, this construction will include utilities, northern trail connections, playgrounds, off-leash dog area, equestrian staging area, picnic areas, community garden, park office and restrooms, sports courts and parking.\nThe first phase of the Alpine Park construction will begin in Spring 2024 with completion expected in Winter 2025.\nThe Alpine Community Planning Group voted to support the project on April 6, 2021.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231206.14.47.51"}
