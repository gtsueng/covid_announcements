When making the recommendation, the CDC provided a very specific list of conditions for people who should receive the additional dose.\n\u201cSan Diegans who are immunocompromised should speak with their doctor to determine the best course of action,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThe best protection against COVID-19 is the vaccine and a third dose will help most people with compromised immune systems from developing severe illness from the virus.\u201d\nThe estimated immunocompromised population in San Diego County is about 26,000. The County has begun working on vaccine plans to meet the guidance being drafted by the CDC for an expansion of additional doses in late September. No details are available currently.\nIn the meantime, Wooten continued to urge unvaccinated San Diegans to get their first dose and for those due a second dose to not delay. The Delta variant, which is more contagious, continues to drive up the number of cases being reported in the region.\n\u201cThe COVID-19 vaccine is the best way to get us out of this pandemic,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cGet vaccinated now to avoid getting sick and passing the virus to others, especially people who are more vulnerable to the disease.\u201d\nThe COVID-19 vaccine is available at medical providers, retail pharmacies, community clinics and County public health centers for people who do not have a medical provider.
