The count continues throughout the day and into the weekend for certain populations.\u00a0\nThis year, 267 County employees volunteered to take part in the Point-in-Time Count.\nIn North region, a County team came across a young man who was cold and had been staying in the storm tunnels. He needed a safe place to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\nStaff with the County\u2019s Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities worked with partners to find him help, including a phone and a hotel room through a referral into the Regional Homeless Assistance Program. As part of the program, he will receive follow-up support to connect to services and resources, including permanent housing.\u00a0\nLater in the morning other County staff joined Caltrans to survey people living in encampments in the South County near freeway ramps and the riverbed in an area called \u201cThe Jungle\u201d.\u00a0 \u00a0\nStaff spoke with several people there who agreed to take part in the survey, covering topics like how long they had been experiencing homelessness, in exchange for a gift card.\u00a0\u00a0\nLast year, the County received two grants totaling $22 million for homeless outreach efforts along the San Diego Riverbed and \u201cThe Jungle\u201d and that work is well underway.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe County has multiple programs in place to help connect people to the services they need, including finding a stable place to live.
