People searching for affordable housing should contact each property directly about availability, how to apply and other requirements. Many of the listings include links to waiting lists.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are excited to make this new interactive tool available to county residents looking for housing,\u201d said David Estrella, County Housing and Community Development Services Director. \u201cBringing all County-funded options together under one resource helps our community members navigate this often-stressful search.\u201d\u00a0\nThe new map aligns with the County\u2019s\u202fHousing Blueprint,\u202fthe County\u2019s guide and ongoing response to the regional housing crisis.\u00a0\nSince 2017, the County has invested $310 million into affordable housing, using excess land, its Innovative Housing Trust Fund and other state, federal and local funding sources administered by the County. Those funds helped open 2,100 units with 3,300 more on the way.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240826.15.50.54"}
