They are available at any SDCL branch to people with a SDCL library card. Customers are also required to sign a form saying they do not have sufficient equipment or services to access the internet. Minors need to have a parent or caregiver compete the form to check out a set.\nThe program started in June, and more than 3,000 have been distributed by branches and through local community organizations helping SDCL identify people with the greatest need. The community feedback has been positive. A young mother from the Lakeside Branch told library staff that the program was life-changing, and an unsheltered customer said she hopes it will enable her to find a job. You can visit your local SDCL branch to check out a TechConnect set today or learn more at sdcl.org/techconnect.\nThe program is just one of many ways the County is closing the digital divide in the region. Additional efforts include a comprehensive broadband plan to help prioritize and guide connectivity solutions in the unincorporated areas, a partnership with Caltrans and SANDAG to underground fiber optic cable along 22 miles of SR 67, and a \u00a0sponsorship of SANDAG\u2019s GetConnected campaign.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220913.08.48.31"}
