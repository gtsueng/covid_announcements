They are a regional resource which means they can answer calls from other law enforcement agencies to keep San Diego County safe.\nThe Explosives Detection K-9s completed a ten-week academy and undergo testing and routine training to ensure their skills remain sharp.\nMeet Archer, he works with Deputy Jovonni Silva.\nTheir specialized roles make them essential in large crowd situations like concerts, sporting events, festivals, parades, airports, transportation hubs, dignitary visits, active shooter incidents and other high-risk scenarios. They can detect even the slightest traces of explosives materials and gun powder, providing a critical layer of protection in our communities.\nDeputy Thomas Nelson shows off his explosives detecting K-9., Nalla.\nAll the dogs are a year old. The yellow and red Labrador Retrievers each cost around $6,500.
