There are currently no public outdoor ranges in East County. This new range will increase access to the sport by reducing travel times.\nThe self-regulated range is open from 8:30 a.m. to sunset and features 10 shooting lanes designed for different skill levels. It is fully ADA-compliant with accessible footpaths, parking, shooting lanes and toilet facilities.\nParks and Recreation staff engaged with local archery advocacy groups, archery clubs, archery industry professionals and the Lakeside Community Planning Group to create an amenities list for the range. This feedback was used to guide the development of the project and concept plan.\nFor more information about the project, visit\u00a0sdparks.org.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250515.16.22.15"}
