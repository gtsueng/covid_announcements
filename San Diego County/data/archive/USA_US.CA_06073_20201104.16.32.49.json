Should the rate continue to be above 7.0 cases per 100,000 residents for a second week in a row, restaurants, gyms, churches, theaters and other locations will need to end indoor operations under state guidance.\n\u201cThe region now is in greater danger of moving into the most restrictive tier, which would mean that indoor activities would cease,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.\nThe state\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, increased slightly from 5.1% to 5.3% which is in the Red Tier. This metric does not on its own allow counties to advance a tier or move to one more restrictive level.\nThe testing positivity percentage dropped from 3.5% to 3.2%, keeping this metric in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.\nWooten urged San Diegans to follow the local health guidance to slow the spread of COVID-19. That includes:\n\nWashing your hands\nKeeping six feet apart from others\nWearing a face covering\nAvoiding crowds and large gatherings\nStaying home if you\u2019re sick\n\n\u201cSan Diegans need to be more dedicated to taking preventing measures to get the region out of the Purple Tier should the County fall into it,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cWe know these measures work to prevent COVID-19 and to slow the pandemic.\u201d\nThe California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis.
