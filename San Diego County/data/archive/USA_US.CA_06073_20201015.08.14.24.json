Remember to sign and date your envelope, seal your completed ballot inside and return it to a trusted source. You can return it by mail, no postage needed, or at one of 126 mail ballot drop-off locations around the county.\n\u201cIf you know how you want to vote, mark your ballot and return it to a trusted source right away,\u201d said Registrar Michael Vu. \u201cThe sooner we get the ballot back, the sooner we can start processing it. Your ballot can be in the first release of Election Night results if you act early.\u201d\nHowever, if you need to vote in person that option is available too. You can do so now:\n\nAt the Registrar\u2019s office, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday\nAt your assigned polling place or the Registrar\u2019s office 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 31 through Monday, Nov. 2.\n\nAll will again be open on Election Day, Nov. 3, when the voting hours change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\nThere will be fewer locations than in prior elections, so your polling place has most likely changed. Larger polling sites, called \u201cSuper Polls,\u201d will accommodate social distancing as required by the COVID-19 guidelines. In addition, Super Polls will be open four days instead of one.\nIf you plan to vote in person, be prepared. Wear your face mask, go to your assigned polling place and maintain social distance.\nThe Registrar\u2019s office encourages older adults and people with underlying medical conditions to avoid long lines and crowded polling places by voting early.\nTo learn more about Vote Safer San Diego and voting in the Nov. 3 election, visit sdvote.com or call (858) 565-5800.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20201015.08.14.24"}
