They do not want to live in an area where their children can\u2019t go out and play or there\u2019s not enough access to healthy foods.\u201d\nSince 2010, the Chronic Disease and Health Equity Unit has led the effort to build better health in the region, a component of\u00a0Live Well San Diego, the County of San Diego\u2019s vision for healthy, safe, and thriving residents and communities.\nThe goal is to reduce and prevent chronic diseases by making healthy living easier and more affordable in the places where people live, work, learn and play.\nHowever, not every neighborhood enjoys the advantages of healthy choices, such as access to fresh, locally grown food, safe physical activity options or smoke-free environments.\n\u201cWe have a duty as a government, and as people, to reverse the systems that don\u2019t allow the same opportunity for everyone,\u201d said Billups.\nAs an example, Billups was part of the effort to get the City of San Diego to adjust its urban agriculture ordinance. That has resulted in more community gardens and recreational facilities and residents being able to be beekeepers and raise goats and chickens in their own backyards.\nCounty public health nutrition manager keeps three goats for milk.\n\u201cPeople want the ability to have hens for eggs and goats for milk,\u201d said Billups, a City Heights resident. She is part of a small co-op that keeps three goats, several chickens and two donkeys at City Farmers Nursery, a place she visits daily to milk the goats, collect the eggs and clean their pens. Billups says she gets all the milk and eggs she needs and the extras she gives to people in her community.\n3-4-50\nBillups was recently named the 2021 Community Change Agent by RISE San Diego. She received the award in partnership with the Nonprofit Institute at the University of San Diego.\n\u201cI am very humbled,\u201d said Billups. \u201cThe award gives me hope, but there\u2019s tons more to be done.\u201d\nBillups received the award for her effort to have a positive impact in the three behaviors that lead to chronic disease.\nTobacco use, poor nutrition, and physical inactivity contribute to\u00a0four major chronic diseases \u2014 cancer, heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, and lung disease \u2014 that lead to more than 50 percent of deaths in the county, a concept referred to as \u201c3-4-50.\u201d\nIn 2010, about 57 percent of San Diegans were dying from the four major conditions. Eleven years later and thanks in part to Live Well San Diego and the Chronic Disease and Health Equity Unit, that figured has dropped seven percentage points.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing some progress in the fight against chronic disease, but thousands of San Diegans are still dying from these preventable diseases,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cSmall changes can make a big difference in individuals, families and communities and can lead to a better quality of life.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211108.10.02.22"}
