To help reach people who may have had difficulty getting to vaccination sites, County officials announced they plan to expand the number of mobile vaccination sites, with a list of new vaccination events stretching into late June at businesses, churches and religious centers, community and senior centers, and other locations.\nCounty officials also announced they have created a \u201cYouth Leadership\u201d video and visual art vaccine challenge/contest, that will start Monday, May 24 and allow submissions through June 14, to engage the county\u2019s youth in the vaccination effort.\nYouths in three age groups, from 12- to 24-years-old, can win prizes for submitting videos and personal artwork about COVID-19 vaccinations in a number of categories. Those include short videos about why getting vaccinated was important to them personally or what they\u2019re most excited about getting back to after being fully vaccinated, or art showing positive facts about COVID-19 vaccinations.\nThe \u201cOur Health is Worth a Shot,\u201d contest will offer prizes to youths in each of the three age categories who create winning videos or paintings, memes, posters, handouts, flyers or infographics.
