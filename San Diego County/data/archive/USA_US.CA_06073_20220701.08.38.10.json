Registrants can earn custom \u201cRide On\u201d socks and a collectible sticker. Attending the meetups is not mandatory; anyone who visits a featured trail can request a sticker at the ranger station. The program was developed by County Parks with the San Diego Mountain Biking Association with the support of REI San Diego, the San Diego County Parks Society and other organizations.\nThe Parks 101: First Timer Series is starting with 13 scheduled events, six in 2022, that will teach participants outdoor essentials under the direction of County staff, including things like how to hike and bike safely, how to camp, fish, kayak and even rock climb. The program is designed specifically for people who, for various reasons, are beginners to outdoor experiences.\nSome of the promotions for the events will include waiving County day-use fees, waived camping fees (for campout events), translation services and providing participants with free equipment to use for events that require specialized equipment.\nFor more information about the Experience the Outdoors Program, the RAD Regional Parks Event Program, the Ride-on Mountain Biking Challenge, and the Parks 101: First-Timer Series, go to sdparks.org/experienceoutdoors.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220701.08.38.10"}
