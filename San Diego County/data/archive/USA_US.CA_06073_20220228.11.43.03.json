Under the act, every active registered voter will automatically receive a ballot in the mail and will have three options for returning that ballot: by mail, to one of the Registrar\u2019s secure ballot drop box locations, or at any vote center in the county. Ballots will start going out in the mail the week of May 9, giving voters nearly a month to mark their ballot and return it before Election Day.\nVoters also have the choice to vote in-person at any one of over 200 vote centers located across the county, which will be open over multiple days. Elections are no longer a one-day event, and there is no need to wait until Election Day to vote.\nThe concept won\u2019t be entirely new to San Diego County voters. The Registrar\u2019s office used a similar format for the November 2020 presidential general and September 2021 gubernatorial recall elections.\nThe Registrar\u2019s office anticipates opening approximately 130 ballot drop box locations starting May 9. Over 200 vote centers will open for four days starting June 4. Nearly 40 of those vote centers will open earlier, May 28, giving voters 11 days to cast their ballots.\nA list of ballot drop box and vote center locations will be available by April 1 at sdvote.com.\nWhat do you need to do?\nBe vote ready!\n\nCheck your voter registration information.
