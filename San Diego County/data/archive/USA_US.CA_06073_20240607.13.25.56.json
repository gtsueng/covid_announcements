The truck, called the Lunch Box, will soon be on the streets providing fresh, healthy and free meals to children in the clubs\u2019 surrounding neighborhoods.\nThe truck is part of the club\u2019s Culinary Options and Opportunities for Kids program which offers culinary and job readiness skills to youth aged 14 to 18. Ultimately, they can apply for paid internships to help prepare the meals for children at the club or for catering on the Lunchbox truck.\nThe grant also helped to fund the Boys & Girls Clubs of Oceanside Youth CanTEEN Food Truck Mentorship program and a summer feeding program that prepared meals for over 600 children. The goal of the CanTEEN program was to provide the skills and mentorship connections at-risk teens need to gain the confidence necessary to become active members in the San Diego restaurant community. By the end of this year-long program, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Oceanside had a total of 55 youth who participated in its culinary arts mentorship program. Youth participating in the program experienced improvement in academics, work readiness and community connections.\nThe County of San Diego and the San Diego District Attorney\u2019s Office awarded the Boys and Girls Club of Oceanside grant money as part of the K-12 Community Grant program. This opportunity was made possible by fines imposed by the court related to the District Attorney\u2019s successful prosecution of one of the nation\u2019s largest fraud schemes targeting state dollars intended for K-12 education. Additional funding and collaboration for the project came from the City of Oceanside, the Parker Foundation, First Citizens Bank and Buffalo Wild Wings Foundation.\n\u201cBecause of their commitment to the program, we can address food insecurity while investing in the future of young people by providing them with workforce readiness and on-the-job experiences,\u201d said Jodi Diamond, CEO of the Boys & Girls Club of Oceanside.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240607.13.25.56"}
