Justice-impacted workers who have paid their debt and want self-sufficiency aren\u2019t given a fair chance at employment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just unfair and it\u2019s not just indecent,\u201d said Lawson-Remer. \u201cIt makes it harder for workers to take care of their families, it makes it harder for honest employees to compete, and it\u2019s illegal.\u201d\nOne of the newest efforts to hold employers accountable is the Workers\u2019 Rights Enforcement Program. It gives the County the authority to prosecute employers who are engaging in unlawful labor practices.\n\u201cSince August, the Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement has handled over more than 400 inquiries related to wage theft and workplace violations,\u201d said County Ethics, Compliance and Labor Standards Director Branden Butler. \u201cOur office is currently investigating 40 cases with the goal of recovering unpaid wages.\u201d\nAnd that is just one County program designed to help people who have lost their pay.\nThe Good Faith Restaurant Program recovered more than $106,000 in lost wages for restaurant workers.\nThe Workplace Justice Fund helped 34 applicants receive financial relief totaling $100,000 last year. This year, the County expects to help another 80 people. The fund helps workers who won legal judgments for lost wages but are still waiting for the money from their employers.\nThe\u00a0DA\u2019s Workplace Justice Unit\u00a0was one of the first in California to investigate and prosecute criminal wage theft cases.\n\u201cWe continue to file case after case. I think we\u2019re up to about 16 cases now and they\u2019re growing, of felony wage theft cases, recovering thousands of dollars to employees who need that money to put bigger shoes on their kids, to put food on the table,\u201d said District Attorney Summer Stephan.\n\u201cIn California, we have some of the strongest laws. These laws have not changed,\u201d said State Labor Commissioner Lilia Garc\u00eda-Brower. \u201cA person labors, and they are to labor under certain conditions. And if they are not laboring under those conditions, then we have an obligation to hold them accountable.\u201d\nThe County regularly works with both the State Department of Industrial Relations and the Employee Rights Center, and together they get results.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most important thing that we can do, is come together as a group rather than think you\u2019re facing this by yourself or that there is no one out there who is aware or wants to help people confront those issues,\u201d said Employee Rights Center Director Alor Calder\u00f3n. \u201cSo, community and the legacy of C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez is our main message this week.\u201d\nEmployers and workers who want more information about workers\u2019 rights, wage theft or how to file a complaint, can visit the Office of Ethics, Compliance and Labor Standards website or call the office at 619-531-5129.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250326.16.56.24"}
