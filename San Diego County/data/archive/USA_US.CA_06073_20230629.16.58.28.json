The total number of new affordable apartment homes will on the site will total more than 400 with the completion of the fourth development. \u00a0\nThe Mt. Etna development is located on the property where the County\u2019s former Crime Lab once sat. It is the second County property this year to host an affordable housing groundbreaking.\u00a0\n\u201cAlthough the title of the Agency doesn\u2019t have housing in it, housing is fundamental to what we do. We strongly believe housing is health and it is an essential human service,\u201d said Dr. Eric McDonald, interim director of the County Health and Human Services Agency. \u201cIt is also important to note that the new homes will remain affordable for 99 years.\u201d\u00a0\nThe size of the investment was also significant.\u00a0\n\u201cThe County invested more than $39 million in land and capital funding in this project,\u201d said David Estrella, director of Housing and Community Development Services. \u201cIt is our largest affordable housing investment to date, and we are excited for the people and future generations who will call this home.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nMore information about the development and availability of homes at the Mt. Etna site is online at the Chelsea Development Corp. website.\u00a0\u00a0\nSince the integration of HCDS Services in 2017 into the Health and Human Services Agency, the department has supported the construction of more than 1,300 new units using County Innovative Housing Trust Fund dollars, excess county property, and other funds leveraged through partnerships. An additional 2,900 units are on the way over the next five years, which collectively will be home to nearly 17,000 San Diegans each night when complete.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230629.16.58.28"}
