That could make it much more expensive for developers to build in the County\u2019s unincorporated areas, where people typically drive farther to reach jobs and amenities.\nOn Wednesday, the Board members voted 3-2 to finish identifying infill areas in unincorporated communities that could potentially allow interested developers to build as many as 5,441 homes without Vehicle Miles Traveled study and mitigation.\nThe Board also voted 3-2 to the longer-range phase, which would start with staff coming back to the Board in four months with a \u201dsustainable land use framework\u201d that could ultimately lead to an update of the County general plan.\n\u201cAdopting a VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) policy is not an option,\u201d Board Chair Nathan Fletcher said, \u201cit is the requirement of state law.\n\u201cThe opportunity in front of us,\u201d he continued, \u201cis to accept that we have to tackle climate change and we have to build housing \u2015 and look for the most legally viable way in which we can put the housing in the right places, meet our climate goals and build more housing than we have ever built before.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220210.11.13.49"}
