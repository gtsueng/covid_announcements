The California Department of Public Health has also deemed this outbreak to be over. The County will continue to closely monitor case counts.\n\u201cI want to sincerely thank the City of San Diego for your continued commitment to the promotion of appropriate and proactive hygienic interventions in your jurisdiction,\u201d Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer, said in the missive. \u201cThe City\u2019s quick response, as well as the continued communication, coordination, and collaboration with the County, have allowed us to successfully eliminate this outbreak.\u201d\nThe shigella outbreak was first identified in early October when six people experiencing homelessness were hospitalized due to shigellosis.\nOn Oct. 11, 2021, the County issued a health advisory to the local medical community to be on the lookout for potential shigella cases.\nAt the same time, the County began working with the City of San Diego, potential exposure sites, and homeless service providers to mitigate the spread of shigellosis by ensuring good sanitation precautions, expanding public restroom availability, distributing personal hygiene kits, working with food service providers, identifying additional cases, and connecting ill people to treatment and housing.\nFor three months, the County held regular meetings with the City and other stakeholders to control the shigellosis outbreak, maintained a website to report cases, and issued news updates informing the public about new cases and containment measures being implemented.\nIn total, 53 shigella cases were connected to the outbreak \u2014 47 confirmed and six probable infections. All cases were identified in people experiencing homelessness. There were no deaths.\nThe County\u2019s ongoing disease investigation efforts will continue to monitor shigellosis cases and potential outbreaks in the region, providing early intervention as needed.
