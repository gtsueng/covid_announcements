Remember, your signature is required for your vote to count.\nOut of the 150 official ballot drop boxes, 118 are located outdoors and are open 24 hours a day up until 8 p.m. on the final day of voting, Nov. 5. The thirty-two remaining boxes are located indoors and only available when the facility where they are housed is open.
