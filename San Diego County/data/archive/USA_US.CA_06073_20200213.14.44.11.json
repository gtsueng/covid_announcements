You may request either an American Independent Party, Democratic Party or Libertarian Party ballot at your designated polling place to vote for one of their presidential candidates. These parties are allowing Nonpartisan voters to vote in their primaries.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, if you want to vote for a presidential candidate in the Green, Peace and Freedom or Republican parties, you must re-register with that party, and you should do so by Tuesday. These three parties are allowing only those registered with their party to vote in their presidential primary.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re not sure about your registration, check your registration status at sdvote.com. If you\u2019re not registered or need to change your registration, you\u2019ll find that information there, too. If your signature is confirmed through records at the Department of Motor Vehicles, it will automatically be sent to the Registrar\u2019s office. If your signature is not confirmed, you can print the online form, sign it and mail it to the Registrar.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor voters without access to a computer, registration forms are also available at the offices of the Registrar of Voters, U.S. Postal Service, City Clerk, public libraries and Department of Motor Vehicles. For voters who need language assistance, election materials are also available in Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese and Chinese.\u00a0\u00a0\nRegistration forms must be postmarked or delivered to the Registrar by Feb. 18.

Voters may also register online until midnight.\u00a0\nEarly voting is already underway at the Registrar\u2019s office in Kearny Mesa, located on the County Operation Center campus at 5600 Overland Ave., San Diego, 92123. Voters can cast their ballots there from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday until Election Day, when the voting hours will change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. to reflect the hours at the polls. The Registrar will also be open between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 29 and Sunday, March 1 for weekend voting.\u00a0\nThere is still time to apply for a mail ballot if that is more convenient.
