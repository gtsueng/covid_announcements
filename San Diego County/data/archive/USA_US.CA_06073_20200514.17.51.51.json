The goal is for the County to submit alternative data that supports a faster reopening that protects both workers and the public.\nSome County Libraries to Provide Door-side Service\nEmployees from some County departments will return to work from their respective offices starting May 15, although most people who have been working at home or remotely will initially continue to do it.\nStarting May 26, some County libraries will be providing door-side service to residents. People can reserve library materials through the County Library online catalog. Library staff will contact patrons to schedule a pick-up date. Beginning June 6, six more libraries will be providing the same service. You can find the list of branches on the Library website.\nFree Food Delivery Program\nThe County also launched Great Plates Delivered, a program that connects qualified older adults in the region with local restaurants to receive three free and healthy meals a day, delivered to their home.\nWhere to Get Tested for COVID-19\nCOVID-19 testing is available through your medical provider, at local hospitals, some community clinics and private labs. If you don\u2019t have a medical provider, call 2-1-1 and they\u2019ll connect you to one.\nThe County\u2019s Live Well Mobile Office will be in Southeastern San Diego from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sat., May 16 at the Euclid Health Center, located at 292 Euclid Ave. An appointment is required and can be set up by calling 2-1-1 and asking to speak to a public health nurse.
