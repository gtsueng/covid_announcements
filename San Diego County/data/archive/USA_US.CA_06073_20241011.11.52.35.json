So, what tops the list?\nNursery & Cut Flower products were 71% of the total agricultural value, followed by Fruit & Nuts group that included crops such as avocados and citrus.\u00a0\u00a0\nBedding Plants, Color, Perennials, Cacti & Succulents continue to reign supreme for the third year in a row, bringing in a total of $396,623,341, which is 24% of the total value of agriculture production in the county.\nThe second most valuable group is Ornamental Trees and Shrubs, valued at $383,114,393, equaling 23% of the region\u2019s overall agricultural production value.\nThe report also shows total production is $1.66 billion in value, which is about $120 million less than 2022. This change is mainly due to the drop in value of Bedding Plants, Color, Perennials, Cacti & Succulents.\nThe report gives a yearly snapshot of agriculture\u2019s contribution to the region\u2019s economy, despite longstanding challenges like the region\u2019s inclement weather, rising water costs, wildfires, freezes and pests.\nDid you know San Diego has 4,031 farms, 94% of which are family farms?

The groups this year that thrived were Field Crops, Apiary Products and Forest Products.\nApiary Products were valued at $4,749,866, a 47% increase from last year. The increase is mainly due to an increase of 264% in Honey and Beeswax production, caused by an increase in rainfall.

This drop was due to lower acreage, demand of products, and prices.\nOther highlights from the report, compared to last year, include:\n\nThe value of Apples spiked by 73% due to higher profits as growers reported a recovery from last year\u2019s 52% drop due to poor weather.\n\n\nThe overall value of Citrus increased by 5% compared to last year despite a 3% decrease in acres. All Citrus crops except Oranges increased in value. Lemons and Kumquats both rose by 21%, while Tangerines, Tangelos rose by 10%. The Citrus value growth is due to increased prices.\n\n\nFruit & Nut Crops\u2019 value decreased to $292,644,242, a 4% drop from the previous year, due to decreased acres and prices\n\n\nThe value of Avocados decreased due to lower acreage, production, and prices.\n\n\nThe value of Grapes, Wine increased by 36% due to growth in production and acres.\n\n\nVegetable & Vine Crops\u2019 value decreased to $89,665,332, a 31% drop from last year. This decrease was mainly due to a 34% drop in the value of Vegetables, Other. However, there was an increase in the value of Squash by 12%.

The top issued certificates of goods grown in San Diego and exported in the United States, included: Ornamental Trees & Shrubs, Cacti & Succulents and Tomatoes.\n\nCounty Programs and Services\nThe report provides crop information and highlights the many diverse programs that the County\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures (AWM) implements to support the food supply, agricultural trade, public health, consumer confidence and a sustainable environment.\nAWM applies state regulatory programs to detect, control and remove harmful insect pests, plant diseases and weeds, which is just one of the many programs the department undertakes and can be read about in the report.\nLast year, AWM inspectors stopped 20 snail and slug infestations and 121 plant diseases.
