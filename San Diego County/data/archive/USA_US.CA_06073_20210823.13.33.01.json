The complete list of roads for the fiscal 2020/21 year runs through Alpine, Bonsall, Crest, Fallbrook, Jamul, Julian, Lakeside, Pine Valley, Ramona, Spring Valley and many others.\u00a0 You\u2019ll know the County is coming to your neighborhood when you receive a letter in the mail, a door hanger notification and see signs posted on streets being resurfaced.\nThe County\u2019s Department of Public Works regularly maintains more than 1,900 miles of unincorporated roads \u2014 long enough to stretch from San Diego to Atlanta, Georgia. The department uses visual and mechanical inspection, as well as input from people and communities, to determine which roads need resurfacing every year.\nThe County\u2019s annual road work received a big financial boost when California\u2019s Senate Bill 1, the Road Repair and Accountability Act, was signed into law in 2017.\nThat led to County supervisors approving an expanded County road improvement plan; the County is currently in the fourth year of that plan. The County resurfaced 154 miles of roads the first year, 131 miles the second year, and is just finishing up 141 miles from the third year.\nRecent advances now allow the County to use up to 25% recycled materials in new pavement, which means resurfacing is more sustainable than ever. In the first three years of the expanded road resurfacing program nearly 200,000 tons of recycled material was reused.\nThe County expects to receive $538 million from SB 1 through 2027.\nSo, when you see a crew out there working, give them a wave.
