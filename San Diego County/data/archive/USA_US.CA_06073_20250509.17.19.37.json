There is only one public elevator in the park.\u00a0\nA trained staff member collected the bat safely.\u00a0 The County Public Health Laboratory confirmed the bat was infected with rabies.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nIf you or someone in your family or group were in the area of the elevator and stairs on May 7 before 10:45 a.m. and had direct contact with the bat, or you know of someone who may have touched the bat, you are urged to contact County Public Health Services as soon as possible at (619) 692-8499.\u202f\u00a0\n\u201cHuman rabies is usually fatal without prompt post-exposure vaccine and treatment,\u201d said Dr. Ankita Kadakia, County interim public health officer. \u201cRabies transmission can happen from a bat bite or if a bat\u2019s saliva comes in contact with a cut or abrasion, or with mucous membranes, such as the eyes, nose or mouth. Although bats can carry rabies, they are an important part of nature in San Diego County. It is important to respect the space of wildlife and do not touch them.\u201d\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nSo far in 2025, the County has detected three rabid bats in the County. There are many species of bats found in San Diego County that feed on insects such as mosquitos. Other bat species feed on nectar from plants and pollinate them in the process. You may\u202fsee bats occasionally around sunset when they are most active.\u00a0\nIt is important to appreciate wildlife from a safe distance and not touch them. If you do come in direct contact with a bat, wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and water and get medical advice immediately.\u202f\u00a0\nRabies is a preventable viral disease that is most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nSymptoms of rabies in people can take weeks to months to develop after being exposed to a rabid animal.\u202f Once symptoms develop, rabies is almost always fatal. However, prompt post-exposure treatment following exposure to the virus will prevent the disease.\u202f\u00a0\nFind more information about bats and rabies on the\u202fCounty\u2019s website.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250509.17.19.37"}
