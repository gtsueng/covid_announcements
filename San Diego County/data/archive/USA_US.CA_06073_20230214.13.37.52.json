So, who\u2019s to say your sweetheart can\u2019t be furry?\nThe County Department of Animal Services is playing matchmaker this week. As part of a Sweetheart Special, starting on Valentine\u2019s Day through Feb. 19, all animals are just $14 to adopt.\nThere is someone for everyone. For those of you who like to be the center of someone\u2019s universe and don\u2019t mind bad breath, try a dog. Maybe you prefer to earn your love, try a cat. If you like the intellectual type, try a pig \u2014 they\u2019re smarter than dogs \u00a0You like slow walks on aquarium beaches, how about a red-eared slider turtle? Recently gone vegetarian? Share a nibble on a carrot with one of our bunnies.\nAll animals will be spayed or neutered, have vaccinations, a microchip and a one-year license for dogs in the service area.\nThe first step to finding a new best friend is browsing all the lovable animals from cats to dogs to chickens and pigs available now on the \u00a0Adoptions\u00a0page. \u00a0Animal Services staff recommend picking out a second and third choice too, just in case your first choice is already chosen by another person.\nWalk-in hours are from 1 to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at both the South Shelter, 5821 Sweetwater Road in Bonita, or the North Shelter, 2481 Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad.\nFill out an application online to print or pick one up at the shelter. Applications can also be emailed but it is quicker to go in person.\nIf you cannot adopt, consider\u00a0fostering\u00a0or\u00a0volunteering.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230214.13.37.52"}
