However, as of Dec. 20, nearly all drive-up COVID-19 testing sites have become appointment-only locations. This change is in response to safety concerns caused by traffic backups. Appointments are accepted up to three days in advance with new appointments becoming available each day about noon.\nThe exception to the appointment-only drive-up testing will be sites operated by the San Diego County Fire Protection District. While appointments are highly recommended, and those with them are given preference, people without appointments will be tested as capacity permits.\n\u201cWith vaccine distribution in its very earliest stage, COVID-19 testing remains extremely important to protect the public\u2019s health,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cPeople experiencing any symptoms, or who feel they have been exposed, are encouraged to get promptly tested. Those with symptoms should isolate until getting results, while others should adhere to the best practices of wearing a mask, social distance, and good hygiene.\u201d\nHoliday testing demand is expected to be high. Wait times at walk-up locations will exceed an hour at times, and the public\u2019s patience is appreciated.\nFor details on testing locations, or to make an appointment at a drive-up location, visit 211sandiego.org or call 2-1-1.\nCertain testing sites are also offering separate no-cost, no-appointment flu vaccination shot clinics.\nTubman Chavez Community Center, 415 Euclid Ave, 92114:\n\nWeekly on Sundays, 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nImperial Beach Sports Park Recreation Center, 425 Imperial Beach Blvd, 91932:\n\nEvery other Saturday, 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., with the next clinic on Dec. 26.\n\nSt. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church (Live Well Mobile Office), 525 W.
