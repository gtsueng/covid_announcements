This is the first human case of West Nile virus reported in the county this year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe man is currently hospitalized and had recently traveled to rural Colorado, where he likely contracted the virus.\u00a0\nWhile this case is not thought to have been contracted in San Diego County, West Nile virus is present here as well, though rare. Earlier this month, a dead bird found in the Clairemont area of San Diego tested positive for West Nile.\u00a0 The most recent human case of West Nile virus in the county was in 2022.\u00a0\nWest Nile virus is mainly a bird disease but can be transmitted to people by some species of local mosquitoes that first feed on an infected bird or animal and then a bite a person.\u00a0\nEighty percent of people who get West Nile virus do not have any symptoms. About one in five people who are infected get a fever and other symptoms such as headache, nausea, fatigue, skin rash or swollen glands. For about 1 out of 150 infected people, West Nile virus can cause serious illness and may be fatal. \u00a0\nCommunity members can follow the County\u2019s Prevent, Protect and Report guidelines to help keep themselves and their families healthy.\u00a0 These guidelines help protect against the Culex mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus as well as the ankle-biting invasive Aedes mosquitoes that can transmit other diseases, including Zika, dengue and chikungunya, if they first bite an infected person and then bite someone else.\u00a0\nPrevent mosquito breeding\nDump out or remove any item inside or outside of homes that can hold water, such as plant saucers, rain gutters, buckets, garbage cans, toys, old tires, and wheelbarrows. Mosquito fish, available for free by contacting the Vector Control Program, may be used to control mosquito breeding in backyard water sources such as unused swimming pools, ponds, fountains and horse troughs.\u00a0\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites\nProtect yourself from mosquito-borne illnesses by wearing long sleeves and pants or use repellent when outdoors. Use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Make sure screens on windows and doors are in good condition and secured to keep insects out.\u00a0\nReport possible mosquito activity\u00a0\nReport increased mosquito activity, or neglected, green swimming pools and other mosquito-breeding sources, as well as dead birds \u2014 dead crows, ravens, jays, hawks and owls \u2014 to Environmental Health\u2019s Vector Control Program by calling (858) 694-2888 or emailing vector@sdcounty.ca.gov.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more information about mosquito-borne illnesses, go to San Diego County\u2019s \u201cFight the Bite\u201d website.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240926.15.47.34"}
