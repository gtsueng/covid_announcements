She had not gotten a flu vaccination and did not have COVID-19 when she died.\n\u201cOur condolences go out the family and friends of the latest flu victim,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cInfluenza can be deadly, especially for older adults who are more susceptible to the virus. If you have not gotten a flu shot, do it now as influenza continues to sicken people in our communities.\u201d\nOf the flu deaths this season, four have been in 2022 and two in late 2021. Last season, a total of two influenza deaths were reported.\nThe flu vaccine is especially recommended for people at higher risk of developing complications from the flu. They include:\n\nPeople with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control\nPregnant women\nPeople aged 65 years and older\nPeople who live with or care for others who are at higher risk\n\nThe latest\u00a0Influenza Watch Report\u00a0from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending May 14, 2022:\n\nEmergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 4% of all visits (compared with 3% the previous week).\nLab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 179 (compared to 186 the previous week).\nTotal lab-confirmed cases to date: 3,082 (compared to 798 at the same time last season and a 11,660 prior 5-year average during the same week).\nInfluenza-related deaths reported to date: six (compared to two last season).\n\nTips to Prevent the Flu\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year.

The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.\nThe influenza vaccine is available at doctors\u2019 offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County\u2019s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County\u2019s\u00a0Flu Vaccine Locations\u00a0page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.\nIn addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:\n\nWash hands thoroughly and often;\nUse hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;\nStay away from sick people;\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;\nClean commonly touched surfaces; and\nIf you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.\n\nDuring the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths.
