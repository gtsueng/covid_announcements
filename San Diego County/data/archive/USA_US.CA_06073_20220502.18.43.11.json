Almost half of the state\u2019s largest and most damaging wildfires occurred in 2020 and 2021, burning almost 7 million acres. But there are proactive steps you can take to prepare your home and communities to be more resilient to the impacts of wildfire.\u00a0\n\nCreate defensible space around your property by maintaining your lawn and removing combustible debris from around your home.\u00a0\nHarden your home by using fire resistant materials for construction, renovation and landscaping to help protect your property.\u00a0\nMake and share a family wildfire emergency plan. Talk to your neighbors about wildfire safety and plan how the neighborhood can work together before and after a wildfire.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSan Diego County is prepared, and we are ready to respond to wildfires,\u201d stated Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher. \u201cSince the devastating 2003 Cedar Fire, your County has invested more than $600 million. Those investments have improved fire protection and EMS, added staffing, fire stations, made communication enhancements, increased training and brush management. We\u2019ve also added more ground and air equipment.\u201d\u00a0\nSupervisor Joel Anderson said, \u201cSome of the things we can do is really focus on the grants to help people harden their homes which we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve all voted to spend $1 million towards that goal. We also worked so that when you need to\u00a0evacuate\u00a0a place like Ramona, Alpine or Fallbrook the roads aren\u2019t restricted. We\u2019ve cut back all the trees along the evacuation routes, so people have a chance to get out.\u201d\u00a0\nThe event was the first of a statewide campaign to help Californians prepare for wildfires. The CAL FIRE Director was there to speak and show off some of the agency\u2019s newest equipment. He was joined by representatives from the California Natural Resources Agency, United States Forest Service, California Office of Emergency Services, the California Military Department, the Highway Patrol and the CAL FIRE San Diego Fire Chief, Tony Mecham.\u00a0\nChief Mecham praised all local fire crews, \u201cSan Diego County is unique, and I believe we are one of the most prepared regions in the United States. And the reason that we are so prepared is we have a mindset of collaboration and cooperation.\u201d\u00a0\nTo learn more about wildfire safety and preparedness, visit readysandiego.org.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220502.18.43.11"}
