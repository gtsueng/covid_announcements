Recommendations guided by the Optimal Care Pathways Model indicate the region needs to increase board and care capacity by nearly 150%. This translates to about an additional 450 beds to assist this vulnerable population.\n\u201cThis funding comes at a time of growing need for more behavioral health housing resources,\u201d said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services. \u201cThese new funds will allow us to preserve and optimize current community-based care infrastructure in alignment with the Optimal Care Pathways Model and help ensure that those who are most vulnerable will get the care and housing that they need.\u201d\nToday\u2019s action allocates $41.5 million for new board and care payments to supplement funds for Medi-Cal clients and help them meet escalating board and care rent costs.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe remaining $2.8 million will be used for infrastructure start-up costs to speed up the creation of new beds.\u00a0\nApproved uses for the Behavioral Health Bridge Housing Program funds include hiring more assisted living workers, outreach and engagement, and start-up infrastructure and housing expenses, which include shelter, interim housing, rental assistance and patch funds for assisted living settings and housing navigation.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230718.16.37.41"}
