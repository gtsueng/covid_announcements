Monoclonal antibodies should be given no more than seven days after the onset of symptoms.\nTreatment centers and medical offices in the region may offer oral antiviral pills, such as Paxlovid and/or monoclonal antibodies delivered as an intravenous infusion. A provider will determine what treatment option is best for each individual patient based on their symptoms, age and potential underlying conditions.\nTreatment is available to individuals who meet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s guidelines for the medications, including those who are at high risk for developing severe COVID-19:\n\nAdults age 50 or older\nPeople of color\nLower economic status\nPeople with underlying condition(s)\nUnvaccinated San Diegans\n\nTo determine which treatment is best for you, talk to your doctor or health care provider, or call 2-1-1 to find a provider.\nPrevent Illness\nSan Diego is currently in the CDC\u2019s high-risk community level for COVID-19, meaning virus transmission is widespread throughout the region.
