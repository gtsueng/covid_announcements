They were laying on cardboard outside a payday advance business. Two men agreed to speak with them and answer a short questionnaire.\nOne of the men told them that a medical condition had impacted his ability to work. The other man said he was experiencing homelessness for the first time. Dahiana gave him a McDonald\u2019s gift card before he rushed off saying he was heading to work.\nThe third man was sleeping, so his location was noted so that outreach workers would know where to find him when they make contact with him at later time.\n\nNext, the team found three more people. Two men and a woman were set up to sleep outside a tire shop. They had sought shelter behind a large tire. One of the men who agreed to take the survey said he had been experiencing homelessness for the past seven years.\nAround 7 a.m., Beatrice, Dahiana and Maria met two more people who were picking up their blankets after waking up at a small business center.\n\nWhile the woman answered the survey, her dog vied for attention from volunteers. When Dahiana gave the woman the McDonald\u2019s gift card, she turned to her dog and promised her a special treat.\n\u201cBeing a social worker for the unsheltered community means that I am walking alongside my clients and assisting them to the next stage in their life journey,\u201d Dahiana explained.\nThe information from the completed surveys is used to apply for federal and state funding to help people experiencing homelessness and find solutions on how to best serve them.\nThe County has multiple programs in place that could connect homeless people to the services they need and help them find a stable place to live. You can find more information\u00a0here\u00a0or by calling 2-1-1.\n    \n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230126.15.48.58"}
