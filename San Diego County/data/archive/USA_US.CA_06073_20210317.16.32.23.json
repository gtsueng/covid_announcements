The store itself is a historic landmark rebuilt in stone in 1875.\nCounty parks department officials said the land fits into the County\u2019s future East County Multiple Species Conservation Plan area. They said the purchase will permanently protect its chaparral, wetland and riparian habitats that are home to animals including the coastal horned lizard, two-striped garter snake, Cooper\u2019s hawk, white-tailed hawk and the federally protected least Bell\u2019s vireo and arroyo toad. Because the land also connects to hundreds of acres of federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, its acquisition will also create important wildlife corridors for animals to travel.\nCounty officials said keeping the land from being developed will also contribute to the County\u2019s drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by eliminating nearly 3,000 metric tons of emissions.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210317.16.32.23"}
