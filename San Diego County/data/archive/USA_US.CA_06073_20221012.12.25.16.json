Local hospitals, including Rady Children\u2019s Hospital, have noted a recent increase in emergency room visits due to flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, which is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. The County is evaluating the possibility of other schools reporting similar outbreaks.\n\u201cWe are coordinating with local school districts and are checking with other school campuses to try and figure out why so many students have been affected so suddenly,\u201d said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. \u201cUnfortunately, we anticipated this would be a rough influenza season, and alongside COVID-19 other respiratory viruses are also making a rapid comeback. If you haven\u2019t already, now is the time to get your flu and COVID-19 shots to gain the extra protections afforded by the vaccines.\u201d\nA total of 304 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported last week,\u00a0bringing the total for the season that started on July 3 to 1,082. At the same time last year, the County had reported only 200 influenza cases.\nGet Vaccinated\nThe flu shot, as well as COVID-19 primary dose vaccines and bivalent boosters are widely available across the region. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated against both viruses every year.\nVaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of developing complications from the flu and COVID-19. They include:\n\nPeople with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control\nPregnant women\nPeople aged 65 years and older\nPeople who live with or care for others who are at higher risk\n\nIt takes about two weeks after vaccination for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The COVID-19 vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.\nThe influenza vaccine is available at doctors\u2019 offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County\u2019s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County\u2019s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.\nIn addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:\n\nWash hands thoroughly and often;\nUse hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;\nStay away from sick people;\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;\nClean commonly touched surfaces; and\nIf you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.\n\nThe final data for the 2021-2022 flu season is still pending and will be available later this year. During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20221012.12.25.16"}
