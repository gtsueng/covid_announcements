Thousands of homes and buildings were destroyed and there was widespread damage to infrastructure and the natural environment. Nearly every San Diegan was affected by the firestorm. Many of those who were spared came to help their neighbors recover from the firestorm.\n\u201cMy neighbors in Alpine came together to show the true fiber of the community.\u00a0 We were close before but became even closer after surviving that experience together,\u201d said Joel Anderson, District Two County Supervisor. \u201cI am grateful to the leaders before me who worked so hard to make our communities safer.\u201d\nSupervisor Anderson spoke about the purchase of a new twin-engine firefighting rescue helicopter for the Sheriff\u2019s Department coming online soon. Anderson also pointed out the County has invested more than $800 million in fire protection and emergency services through County Fire and the Fire Protection District.\nCAL FIRE San Diego Chief Tony Mecham talked about the improved collaboration and communication between community leaders.\n\u201cEvery fire department in this County sees wildland fire as a collective problem, I share the same vision with the other fire chiefs. The emergency response must be quick and sufficient to suppress wildland fires before they get out of hand,\u201d said Mecham.\n\u201cWe have learned a great deal from the Cedar Fire, and we have used that knowledge to improve our operations and make our community safe,\u201d said San Diego Fire-Rescue Chief Colin Stowell.\nChief Stowell spoke about his experience working as a Fire Captain 20 years ago in Scripps Ranch. He said the tragedy taught us valuable lessons about interagency communications and the importance of investing in air assets here at home. San Diego Fire-Rescue now operates three firefighting helicopters.\nSheriff\u2019s Department Captain Tom Seiver spoke of law enforcement\u2019s role in disasters. Captain Seiver emphasized the need for people to evacuate when told to do so.\n\u201cIf you choose to stay at home during an evacuation order, not only do you put your life in danger, but also the lives of first responders,\u201d said Captain Seiver.\nThe speakers encouraged the community to have an evacuation plan.\n\u201cInvestments in technology over the years have bolstered our regional preparedness and response capabilities,\u201d said County Emergency Services Director Jeff Toney. \u201cWe encourage everyone to have an evacuation plan and heed the messages to evacuate whether it is delivered to your phone, through law enforcement, or through the media.\u201d\nYou can register your cell phone with AlertSanDiego to receive emergency alerts and download the SD Emergency app to stay informed through all disasters.\n\u201cNo matter the patch or color of the fire engine, firefighters in San Diego County take wildland fires seriously and will come together to protect the lives and property of the residents we serve,\u201d said Mecham. \u201cWe believe in \u2018one team, one mission\u2019 and that is what has been created in San Diego County.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231026.12.56.40"}
