The last time more than 1,150 cases were reported was Sept. 10 when 1,188 cases were identified.\n\u201cUnfortunately, rises like these after holidays are not unexpected,\u201d said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. \u201cWe are vigilant for any changes in cases that Omicron might cause, but we\u2019ve seen similar spikes like this in the past.\u201d\nKaiser says more case increases are likely to occur during the next couple months because of other upcoming holidays.\n\u201cCounty residents need to be mindful that Delta is still out there,\u201d Kaiser said. \u201cIndoor masking, vaccination and good hygiene are still strongly advised. People should not visit family and friends or go to work if you\u2019re ill.\u201d\nWith recent detections of the Omicron variant in Los Angeles and San Francisco, the County continues to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health to review existing recommendations as more data becomes available.\nCounty health officials urge San Diegans to continue following the measures to protect against all varieties of COVID-19, including the Omicron variant. They are:\n\nGet vaccinated and get a booster if you qualify. The vaccine is available at health care providers, retail pharmacies and community clinics. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the\u00a0My Turn website.\nWear a mask, especially in public indoor settings, regardless of vaccination status.\nGet tested if you have any symptoms, whether you\u2019ve been vaccinated or not. You can make a free test appointment or find a walk-in test clinic at coronavirus-sd.com.\nWash your hands frequently and stay home if you\u2019re sick and distance yourself from others.\n\nMore information about COVID-19, testing and vaccinations can be found at coronavirus-sd.com.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211203.14.48.15"}
