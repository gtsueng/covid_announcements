Experts say it affects how people feel about themselves, how they handle stress, make choices and relate to others. San Diegans\u2019 mental health should be as important as their physical, but, too often, it gets overlooked or ignored.\nMay is Mental Health Matters Month and County behavioral health officials say there\u2019s no better time than now to take stock of your mental health and the mental well-being of those you care about.\nThroughout May, the County and its many partners are asking San Diegans to help raise awareness about the importance of mental health. By doing that, you will help to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness which is what keeps people from getting the help they need. A list of organizations and activities taking place in May is available here.\n\u201cThe sooner people reach out for help, the better off they will be. It\u2019s important for everyone to observe and check their emotional well-being and to share with friends and loved ones how they\u2019re feeling,\u201d said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. \u201cTaking good care of our minds and engaging in self-care activities is a good exercise to improve our behavioral health and improve our overall quality of life.\u201d\nBergmann says San Diegans should use the Mental Health Matters Month resources as an opportunity to promote community awareness of mental health and check in with people who may be struggling or recovering from a mental health condition.\nIn the past few years, the County has made significant increases in investment and funding to provide better access to behavioral health services.\nPeople needing immediate behavioral health assistance should call 9-1-1. Help is also available by calling the County\u2019s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 or 2-1-1 San Diego or by visiting\u00a0www.Up2SD.org.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220504.16.19.28"}
