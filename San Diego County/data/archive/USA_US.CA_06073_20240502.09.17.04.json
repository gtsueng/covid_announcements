It does more to help people and families with housing, nutrition, health, financial and other needs.\nThe County put additional funding into affordable housing, roads, justice reform, public safety and environmental sustainability. The budget retains funding for core services like fire protection, libraries and parks.\nOverall, the recommended budget for 2024-25 totals $8.48 billion, an increase of $317.7 million or 3.9% over the 2023-24 adopted budget, with an emphasis on investments in key priorities while sustaining core services and efficiently managing the growth of staffing.\nThe plan calls for roughly 72 new positions, a 0.4% increase.\nNearly 3.3 million people live in the county and the budget touches everyone in some way. Regionally, the County provides food and restaurant inspections, beach and bay water testing, elections, social services, health programs, foster care, adult protective services and more.\nIn addition, the County provides city-type services for those who live outside of the region\u2019s 18 cities, the unincorporated area. It is so large that if it were a city, by population, it would be the second largest in the region. There, the County supplies police and fire protection and maintains parks, libraries and roads.\nAlmost half of the funding comes from federal and state governments, but that money must be used on certain programs. The rest comes from property taxes, fees for services and other sources.\nThe budget reflects the County\u2019s values: integrity, equity, access, belonging, excellence and sustainability. It maintains current services and funds new ones, using data and community input gathered throughout the year and considering equity for vulnerable populations.\nYou can learn more about the recommended budget by reviewing an executive summary or the full recommended budget plan.\nYou can give your feedback in person and online. An in-person community budget meeting is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, May 23 at the County Operations Center. A virtual community meeting will take place at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, May 29. \u00a0Visit our open budget page for more information.\nYou can also give your feedback and let us know how you prefer to receive updates on the budget process by leaving comments at\u00a0Engage San Diego County now through June 13.\nYou can watch, listen and participate\u00a0in budget presentations, hearings, deliberations and adoption at upcoming Board of Supervisors meetings.
