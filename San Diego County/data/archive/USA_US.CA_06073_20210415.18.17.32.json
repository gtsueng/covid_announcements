This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.\nOf those vaccinated to date, more than 768,000 County residents, or 28.6% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nOverall, more than 1.23 million County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That\u2019s 45.9% of those eligible.\nThe goal is to fully vaccinate\u00a075% of San Diego County residents 16 and older or 2,017,011 people.\nThose who received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine,\u00a0which is currently on hold\u00a0in the County due to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration, are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s\u00a0vaccination dashboard. For vaccination opportunities, visit\u00a0www.vaccinationsuperstation.com.\n\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 6.0 cases per 100,000 residents (as of April 13).\nThe County remains in the Orange Tier or Tier 3 under the state\u2019s new guidance. The California Department of Public Health recently advised that unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as low rate of vaccine uptake, a county will only move to a more restrictive tier if hospitalizations are increasing significantly among vulnerable individuals, especially among vaccinated individuals, and both testing positivity and adjusted case rates show a concerning increase in transmission. This is currently not the case in the region.\nCurrently, the testing positivity percentage is 2.5%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 3.0% and is also in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.\nCDPH assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, April 20.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nThree new community outbreaks were confirmed April 14, all of them in restaurant/bar settings.\nIn the past seven days (April 8 through April 14), 17 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n17,942 tests were reported to the County on April 14, and the percentage of new positive cases was 2%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 1.9%. Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 13,023.\n\nCases, Hospitalizations and ICU Admissions:\n\n281 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County on April 14. The region\u2019s total is now 274,249.\n15,047 or 5.5% of all cases have required hospitalization.\n1,667 or 0.6% of all cases and 11.1% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nFive additional COVID-19 deaths were reported April 14. The region\u2019s total is 3,653.\nAll of these deaths occurred several months ago but were just added to the list after a rigorous review of death certificates that were incorrect or incomplete and required the analysis of the patients\u2019 medical records to determine if they were COVID-19 deaths.\nThree women and two men died between Dec. 19, 2020 and February 16, 2021.\nOf the people who died, three were 80 years of age or older and two were in their 60s.\nFour had underlying medical conditions and one did not.\n\nMore Information:\nThe more detailed data summaries found on the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0are updated around 5 p.m. daily.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210415.18.17.32"}
