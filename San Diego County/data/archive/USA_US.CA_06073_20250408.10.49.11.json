A panel of 100 construction industry members judged the entries and after several elimination rounds, the SELWC was awarded first-place win.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Live Well Center had previously been honored by ENR prior to being announced as best of the best in their Western Region, and then in the nation-wide Government Category. The Award of Excellence gala and award presentation was held in New York City on March 27.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cOur experience with the Southeastern Live Well Center has reshaped the way we approach new building development here at the County,\u201d said Marko Medved, Director of County General Services. \u201cThe community helped shape this facility from start to finish and we are so proud of the final product.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Best of the Best win put the SELWC on the cover of ENR\u2019s March 2025 national publication along with a feature write up inside the magazine and online.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \nThe $63.5 million project was praised for acknowledging the socioeconomically diverse and historically marginalized community the facility serves and the meaningful involvement of community members in every step of development.\u00a0\n\u201cThere was a lot of initial distrust of the county in the community,\u201d said Medved. \u201cWe had to make personal connections and stand behind our commitments, truly integrating them into the process.\u201d\u00a0\nThe SELWC also received top marks for its energy saving efficiency, trauma informed design, expansive open spaces and lots of bright light from large windows and skylights. The project\u2019s warm colors and numerous public art pieces inside and outside the building were also celebrated for creating a sense of comfort, healing and belonging.\u00a0\u00a0\nAdditionally, the County\u2019s dedication to community engagement helped secure the SELWC\u2019s first place win. For the first time in a County development, the design-build team committed to hiring contractors from surrounding zip codes, spending $8 million via local community firms. Ultimately, 14 percent of the SELWC workforce lived in the community, nearly tripling the initial 5 percent goal.\u00a0\nInformation is available online about the SELWC and the services available to the public.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250408.10.49.11"}
