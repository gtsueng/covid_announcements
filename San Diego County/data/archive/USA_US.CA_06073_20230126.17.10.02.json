A homeless shelter at the old Central Library on E Street is now open and has 36 beds available overnight to women exclusively.\nThe shelter will be operated by NAMI, the National Alliance for Mental Illness, and provide case management, access to social services and housing support. It will be open through the night for any female who shows up at the door requesting a bed, regardless of the hour.\nThe County provided $322,000 in funding for the shelter as part of a $10 million dollar grant program to support shelter opportunities for the unhoused throughout the region. It is one of four City of San Diego projects receiving funding not including the Rosecrans shelter.\n\u201cIt is important for the County to support a variety of housing options throughout the region,\u201d said County Health and Human Services Agency Director Nick Macchione. \u201cWhen it comes to addressing homelessness, there is no single right answer.\u201d\nA total of nine projects have been identified to receive county grant money which will create 372 new shelter beds across six cities. The projects range from serving families and seniors to providing safe parking and sleeping cabins.\n    \n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230126.17.10.02"}
