The program provides defensible space and home retrofits to harden homes against wildfires. In many cases, the work is provided at no cost to the homeowner and is intended to help high social vulnerability communities and provide assistance to qualifying low- and moderate-income households.\nAt one home, contractors removed trees and brush from areas right next to a home to create defensible space. Then construction contractors moved in to replace combustible materials untreated wood trim, a wood deck, nylon window screens, and vents in the foundation and roof to further protect the home from wildfires and embers.\nThe funding for the pilot program is provided by a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES).
