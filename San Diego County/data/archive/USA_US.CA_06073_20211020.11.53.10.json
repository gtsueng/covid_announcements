The vaccine is safe and effective and can help prevent people from getting sick, ending up in the hospital or, worse, dying.\u201d\nThe County Health and Human Services Agency has begun publishing the weekly\u00a0Influenza Watch\u00a0report, which tracks key influenza indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
