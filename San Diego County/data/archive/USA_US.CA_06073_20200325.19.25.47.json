Testing is not required if the patient is not severely ill, not in a priority population, or not at high risk for complications.\n\u201cTesting people who have mild or moderate symptoms, but are not at higher risk of severe complications depletes testing resources and scarce personal protective equipment and exposes other patients and health care personnel to COVID-19,\u201d Wooten said, adding that this recommendation might change when testing is more widely available.\nSo, what should you do if you think you have COVID-19 symptoms?\nStay at home.\nIf you\u2019ve had symptoms, the recommendation is for you to stay home under the following conditions:\n\nAt least three days (72 hours) have passed since recovery, defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms such as cough or shortness of breath; and\nAt least seven days have passed since symptoms first appeared.\n\n\u201cWe all should we doing everything we can to flatten the curve since this is a life-saving action,\u201d Wooten said.\nIf you have questions about COVID-19 testing, please talk to your healthcare provider or call 2-1-1 to talk to a public health nurse.\nCases Rise to 297\nThe total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased to 297 Wednesday, 55 more than the previous day. No additional deaths were reported.\nOf the 297 cases, 277 were San Diego County residents and 20 were non-residents. Starting Thursday, the non-residents will be dropped from the table to conform with the practices of other health departments across the state. The number of cases connected to the federal quarantine is no longer included in the County\u2019s total.\nThe County\u2019s daily coronavirus in San Diego\u00a0webpage now also contains a graph showing new positive cases and total cases reported by date.\nFor more information, visit\u00a0www.coronavirus-sd.com.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200325.19.25.47"}
