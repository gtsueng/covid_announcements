When recycled in the right way, trees and wreaths can become mulch that improves soil health and helps soil retain moisture at our parks, farms and home gardens.\nCheck with your waste hauler to find out if they offer curbside pickup; many do. Another option is to visit the County\u2019s recycling and hazardous waste database\u00a0WastefreeSD.org/TreeRecycling to find Christmas tree drop-off sites near you.\nType \u201cChristmas tree\u201d in the \u201cfind an item\u201d box, add your ZIP code, community and how you heard about the site, and you\u2019ll see all the drop-off locations near you.\nDon\u2019t leave your old, dry tree or wreaths lying in your backyard. They can become fire hazards. Meanwhile, putting them in the trash unnecessarily fills up landfills and generates unwanted greenhouse gases when they decompose.\nKnow What Packaging Can be Recycled\nBetween online shopping and gift exchanges, there\u2019s usually a lot of stuff to recycle. Remember, not all packaging can be recycled. For example, cardboard boxes can be recycled (just break them down and put them into your recycling bin). But other items can\u2019t \u2014 manila envelopes, padded plastic mailers and bubble-wrap, and traditional gift-wrapping materials including ribbons, bows, twine, tissue paper and cellophane. So please DO NOT put them in your blue recycling bins; consider re-using them instead. Here\u2019s a link to learn more about how to\u00a0Recycle Right, during the holidays and every day.\nChristmas and Holiday Card Recycling\nLike packaging materials, not all holiday cards should be added to your recycling. Simple paper cards and envelopes can be added to your blue bins. But cards with glitter, foil, metallic inks (made with tiny metal flakes) or other adornments can\u2019t. Tear the cards in two if there\u2019s a glitzy front and plain paper backing. Recycle the backs and put the glitzy fronts into the trash.\nHoliday Light Recycling\nPlease remember to not put old holiday lights in your recycling bins. They can tangle up recycling equipment and they also pose a danger to workers in those recycling centers.\u00a0For recycling options, please visit\u00a0WasteFreeSD.org, or contact a scrap metal or e-waste recycler.\nIt\u2019s so easy! Remember, if you have other questions about what can and can\u2019t be recycled, go to\u00a0DPW Recycling\u2019s webpage\u00a0or to\u00a0DPW Recycling\u2019s Facebook page.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231219.09.56.56"}
