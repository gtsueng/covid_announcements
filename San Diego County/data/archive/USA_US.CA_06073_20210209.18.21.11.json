These funds will assist San Diegans who have been economically impacted by COVID-19 in paying for housing expenses.\nThe program will serve people who reside in the unincorporated areas of the County, as well as San Diegans living in 16 cities within the region. The cities of San Diego and Chula Vista received funding directly from the federal and state governments and will not be covered under the County\u2019s program.\nThe emergency rental assistance program is open to both County residents who have applied to previous emergency rental assistance programs, and those who have not received rental assistance through the initiative. The County will soon open the application period for the program and area residents who want to learn more about the initiative and how to apply for COVID-19 rental assistance, can find more information here.\nSmall Business Grants\nThe Board also voted to provide additional stimulus funds to small businesses that have suffered economic hardship due to the pandemic. The Board voted to allocate at least $30 million to the Small Business Stimulus Grant Program once the federal and state government appropriate funds to the County in the coming weeks.\nToday\u2019s Board action allows County staff to prepare the next round of the program so grants can be distributed to qualified applicants as soon as the funds come in. Depending on the timing of federal government approval, the Board may call a special meeting to finalize the details of the next round of the program once the County receives the funds.\nThe upcoming round will be open to small businesses and nonprofit entities with 20 or fewer employees. As with prior grants, Board offices will determine final eligibility for businesses in their respective jurisdictions.\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 34.2 cases per 100,000 residents and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 9.1%, placing the County in Tier 1 or the Purple Tier.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 12.1% and it\u2019s in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.
