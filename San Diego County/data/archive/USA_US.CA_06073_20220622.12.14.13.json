The County will release a final report with total case numbers for the 2021-2022 season later this summer.\nSo far this year, there have been 3,999 cases of influenza and seven deaths. At the same time last year, there had been 848 cases and two deaths.\n\u201cWe saw a lot more flu cases this season when compared to last, as well as a late-season surge in influenza activity,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cWhile cases are trending down at this time, seasonal influenza vaccinations are still available and encouraged, especially for those at higher risk of adverse outcomes.\u201d\nThe latest\u00a0Influenza Watch\u00a0report\u00a0from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending June 18, 2022:\n\nEmergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 5% of all visits (compared to 4% the previous week).\nLab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 147 (down from 178 the previous week).\nTotal lab-confirmed cases to date: 3,999 (compared to 842 at the same time last season and a 11,758 prior 5-year average during the same week).\nInfluenza-related deaths reported to date: seven (compared to two last season).\n\nTips to Prevent the Flu\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The COVID-19 vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.\nThe influenza vaccine is available at doctors\u2019 offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County\u2019s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County\u2019s\u00a0Flu Vaccine Locations\u00a0page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.\nIn addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:\n\nWash hands thoroughly and often;\nUse hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;\nStay away from sick people;\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;\nClean commonly touched surfaces; and\nIf you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.\n\nDuring the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220622.12.14.13"}
