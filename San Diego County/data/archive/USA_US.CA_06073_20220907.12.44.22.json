Rain runoff can sweep topsoil, mud, plant material and debris off land and downstream where it can damage homes, clog culverts and storm drains, and flood and damage roadways.\nSand and bags, or bags alone, will be available for unincorporated residents at the fire stations located below.\nPeople should call ahead to double-check availability and remember to bring a shovel to fill the bags.\u00a0Some stations may have a limited supply.\nSand and Bags\n\nBonita: Bonita-Sunnyside Fire Station: 4900 Bonita Road, Bonita, CA 91902, P: 619-479-2346\nBoulevard: Boulevard Fire Station #47: 40080 Ribbonwood Road, Boulevard, CA 91905, P: 619-390-2020\nDe Luz:\u00a039431 De Luz Road, Fallbrook, CA 92028 P: 760-728-2422\nDulzura: Dulzura Fire Station #30: 17304 Highway 94, Dulzura, CA 91917, P: 619-468-3391\nFallbrook: Pala Mesa Fire Station #4, 4375 Pala Mesa Drive, Fallbrook, CA 92028, P: 760-723-2024\nJulian: Julian-Cuyamaca: Fire Station #56, 3407 Hwy 79, Julian, CA 92036, P: 760-765-2885\nRamona: Ramona Fire Station #82, 3410 Dye Road, Ramona, CA 92065, P: 760-789-0107\nRincon: Rincon Fire Station #70: 16971 Highway 76, Pauma Valley, CA 92061, P: 760-742-3243\nWarner Springs: Sunshine Summit Fire Station #59, 35227 Highway 79, Warner Springs, CA 92086, P: 760-782-9113\n\nBags Only\n\nAlpine: Alpine Fire Station #17 1364 Tavern Road Alpine, CA 91901 P: 619-445-2635\nBorrego Springs: Ocotillo Wells Fire Station #54 5841 Highway 78, Borrego Springs, CA 92004 P: 760-767-7430\nCampo: Campo Fire Station #40 31577 Highway 94, Campo, CA 91906 P: 619-478-5516\nCampo: Lake Morena Fire Station #42 29690 Oak Drive, Campo, CA 91906 P: 619-478-5960\nDescanso: Descanso Fire Station #45 24592 Viejas Grade Road, Descanso, CA 91916 P: 619-445-7508\nEl Cajon: Harbison Canyon Fire Station #24 551 Harbison Canyon Road, El Cajon, CA 92019 P: 619-445-5001\nEscondido: Deer Springs Fire Station #13 10308 Meadow Glen Way East, Escondido, CA 92026 P: 760-751-0820\nEscondido: Miller Fire Station #15 9127 W.
