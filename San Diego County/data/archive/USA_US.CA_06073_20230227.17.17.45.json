This hospital-based CSU provides immediate behavioral health care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for anyone in crisis. Clients can be dropped off or walk up to receive the services and support they need.\nThe CSU offers crisis intervention, medication management, short-term counseling, care coordination, and connections to ongoing behavioral health and primary care services when applicable.\u00a0It is a safe, compassionate alternative to emergency rooms and jails.\nThe CSU has proved to be a critical South County resource for families, friends, law enforcement, first responders and outreach partners. It\u2019s presence has helped decrease the number of patients who end up in Emergency Departments and has shortened the time law enforcement officers wait with clients in crisis who need treatment.\nThe Bayview CSU opened in April of 2021. COVID restrictions delayed the ribbon cutting, which was celebrated today. The CSU is part of a network of six community-based crisis stabilization units across the county, serving more than 8,500 clients in 2022 alone.\nAnyone needing immediate behavioral health assistance should call 9-1-1. Help is also available by calling the County\u2019s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 or visiting\u00a0www.Up2SD.org.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230227.17.17.45"}
