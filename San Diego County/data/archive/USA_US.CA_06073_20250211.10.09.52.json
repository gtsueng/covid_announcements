It only takes a few inches of water to get a vehicle to float away, and there\u2019s no guarantee the roadway below hasn\u2019t been washed out. You can report flooded roadways or other unsafe road issues in the unincorporated area by calling (877) 684-8000.\nThe same caution is true for pedestrians, if moving water can sweep a car away, it can easily do the same to people. Do not try to wade through a flooded roadway.\nIf your home gets an evacuation warning, or if you feel unsafe, evacuate.\nStay informed on adverse weather conditions, with official information from the National Weather Service or news outlets.\nVisit AlertSanDiego.org for disaster preparedness tips including flooding.\nTo receive emergency alerts for your area, download the Genasys Protect app or in the App Store or Google Play.\n\nFor information on how to use sandbags to divert water from your homes or businesses or where to get them, and additional driving tips, see First Big Rains on the Way, Sandbags Available.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250211.10.09.52"}
