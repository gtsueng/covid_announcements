This was also the first public COVID-19 briefing for the three new board members who were sworn in last week.\nThe Board voted to increase enforcement on businesses and operations that are not in compliance with the safe reopening plans and extended the Great Plates Delivered program providing free meals and income stipend programs. The Board also voted to ensure that enforcement efforts are being applied consistently based on scientific data around how and where COVID-19 spreads.\nBoard members also directed staff to look into whether it is possible to exclude businesses that have repeatedly violated public health orders from eligibility for COVID-19 financial assistance programs.\nTo date, the County has received more than 17,000 complaints about health order violations and the County\u2019s Safe Reopening Compliance Team has issued 335 cease and desist orders. Complaints about violations have exponentially increased since the region moved into the Purple Tier in November, with more than half of all complaints made in the past month.\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Rollout\nRight now vaccine supply remains limited and only San Diegans who fall into Phase 1A of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution can get vaccinated. This includes primarily people who work in health care and employees and residents of long-term care facilities. Healthcare personnel who are eligible to be vaccinated at this time are encouraged to contact their medical provider first to request a vaccination.\nPhase 1A eligible residents who are unable to get vaccinated through their health care provider, can make an appointment online at\u00a0www.VaccinationSuperStationSD.com. Appointments are limited and individuals are encouraged to check the website regularly if they cannot secure an appointment right away.\n\u201cWe understand that demand for the COVID-19 vaccination is high and that our community has many questions about the vaccination process,\u201d said Nick Macchione, director of the County Health and Human Services Agency. \u201cThe County will roll out a website feature soon that will clarify the tier system and allow the general public to sign up for notifications about when and where they can get their COVID-19 vaccine. A dashboard is also being developed that will show how many San Diegans have been vaccinated with their first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\nICU Capacity and Stay Home Order:\n\nThe current intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability for the Southern California region is 0.0% and will be updated by the state daily.\nThe\u00a0Regional Stay Home Order\u00a0is in effect and prohibits gatherings of any size with people from other households and adds restrictions for multiple sectors.\nThe order will last until the region\u2019s ICU availability meets or exceeds 15%.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nSix new community outbreaks were confirmed on Jan. 11: two in business settings, one in a distribution warehouse setting, one in a faith-based agency setting, one in a government setting and one in a health care setting.\nIn the past seven days (Jan. 5 through Jan. 11), 48 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n18,119 tests were reported to the County on Jan. 11, and the percentage of new positive cases was 19%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 13.8%.
