Drownings can be silent and happen within 30 seconds. Visit sdswimsafer.org for safety tips, swim class resources and ways to keep your home pool secure. The County\u2019s Fire Protection District Safe Swimming program provides free pool alarms to eligible residents.\u00a0\n\nSecure windows -summertime brings warmer temperatures and you may be opening up windows. Open windows can be a hazard for small children. County partner The Children\u2019s Initiative offers education and resources to prevent injuries like falls from windows. \n\nAhead of summer travel, make sure your child has received an updated measles, mumps, and rubella or MMR vaccine, particularly ahead of international travel. Contact your child\u2019s healthcare provider or visit a County public health center if you do not have a healthcare provider to find the MMR vaccine.\n\nKeep your child safe from the sun and heat by applying and reapplying sunscreen several times a day, avoiding active play outside during the hottest parts of the day between 12 and 4 p.m. and providing plenty of water. Relief from the heat is available at County Cool Zones\u00a0including County libraries which also offer fun summer activities for children. \n\nWear a helmet while riding a bike, skateboard or scooter, it is one of the best ways to protect children from serious injuries. Helmets should be properly fitted and equipment should be size-appropriate. There are programs funded through the County Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities, including Circulate San Diego and Vista Community Clinic programs that promote riding safety.\u00a0\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240712.09.46.16"}
