Over the past three years, more than 976,000 San Diegans have laboratory confirmed positive tests for COVID-19, more than 38,500 have been hospitalized and 5,728 died.\nCounty Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., noted the County\u2019s focus on mass testing, treatment, vaccinations and investigation and tracing proved positive and saved people from dying.\n\u201cSadly, while lives have been lost, combined community efforts, including enhanced surveillance, accessible and equitable testing and vaccination strategies, and provision of appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), have saved lives,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cEarly and thorough response from the County of San Diego resulted in an estimated 3,307 lives saved, from Feb. 14, 2020, through Nov. 13, 2021, according to an analysis by the County\u2019s Community Health Statistics Unit.\u201d\nCounty Health and Human Services Agency Director Nick Macchione thanked current and former County supervisors, County Chief Administrative Officer Helen Robbins-Meyer, County employees, nurses, physicians, therapists, local hospitals, healthcare facilities, CAL FIRE, first responders, the County\u2019s 18 cities, community partners, community-based organizations, the public and the media for their part in addressing a \u201cgenerational pandemic.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we accomplished collectively is regarded as one of the best responses in the nation, with recognition from the federal government, the governor and the state, and many other leaders.\u201d Macchione said, \u201cWe set the bar for others to follow.\u201d\nThe County\u2019s comprehensive local response to protect the public\u2019s health with an equity focus featured numerous actions, including:\n\nRapidly deploying widespread testing and mass vaccinations\nKeeping people informed across sectors from education to faith based and through open and frequent media communications\nEmploying \u201cpromotoras\u201d\u2014community health workers\nProcuring outreach contracts with various and ethnic community organizations\nWorking with long-term care facilities that housed people at high risk of the virus\nSurveilling wastewater to detect and gauge virus levels\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, the County has invested more than $1 billion to fight coronavirus, not only through health actions, but also by providing food, housing and child-care assistance, as well as stimulus to help businesses and people hurt by COVID-19. Nearly 2.7 million San Diegans have received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and more than 560,000 have received a bivalent booster vaccine.\nMore information about the County\u2019s ongoing response to COVID-19 is available online on the County COVID-19 website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230207.17.06.24"}
