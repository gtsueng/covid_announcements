Once MCRT arrives on-scene they assess the person, de-escalate any concerns, and connect them with services like counseling, case management, and substance use treatment.\u00a0\nPreliminary regional call volumes show the East region responding to 445 calls this summer compared to 359 calls in the Central region. North Coastal received 297 calls, South received 272 and North Inland 187 from June to August.\u00a0\nNearly 30% of all MCRT clients were under 25-years-old, emphasizing the need to expand support to youth in schools to connect students with behavioral health experts quickly.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230926.12.59.07"}
