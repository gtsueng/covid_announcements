Many neighborhood pharmacies offer same day testing as do other locations on this list. The County, which has about 10 percent of the region\u2019s testing capacity, has a network of no-cost testing public sites that are both walk-up and can take appointments.\nTogether, all testing sites have the capacity to perform about 45,000 tests daily. Rapid antigen tests, which are available at many local pharmacies, are a good option if a testing site is unavailable. Those who test positive on a rapid should follow the healthcare guidance and generally do not need a confirmatory PCR test unless instructed by a doctor.\n\u201cCurrently, there is a high demand for COVID-19 testing so we\u2019re asking San Diegans to be patient as testing traffic can surge and sites can be very busy,\u201d Kaiser said.\nAvoid Fake COVID-19 Testing Sites\nThe County is also warning San Diegans about potential scams from \u201cpop up\u201d sites that are offering \u201cfree\u201d COVID-19 testing.\nAll legitimate COVID-19 testing sites should be able to show you their medical credentials upon request.\u00a0They should also be able to tell you what laboratory test is being used, where the test is being run and how the results will be reported.\nA testing site could be fake if:\n\nThey ask for social security numbers or other non-medical information\nMaterials do not have a logo\nSite is on a sidewalk and not affiliated with a medical provider\n\n\u201cSan Diegans should be wary as some pop-up sites could be personal information scams. If you have doubts, go to a County or community pharmacy COVID-19 testing site,\u201d Kaiser said.\nCOVID-19 Vaccines Widely Available\nAlso, the region has plenty of COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses, which remain the best long-term protection against COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.\nThere are more than 400 vaccination sites that include pharmacies, medical providers, clinics and County locations; the region has the capacity to meet demand.
