Gavin Newsom\u2019s new coronavirus message a day after he issued a statewide \u201cstay home\u201d order to stop the spread of the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease.\n\u201cThe message is very clear,\u201d County Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., said. \u201cAll Californians are being asked to stay at home if you do not need to go out for essential reasons.\u201d\nEssential reasons include buying food, picking up medications and even exercising as long as people do so by practicing social-distancing and keeping six feet apart from individuals other than your household members.\nWooten and other County officials also said the number of San Diego County\u2019s COVID-19 cases continues to rise. But they added that everyone in the general public does not need to get tested for the virus.\n\u201cEighty percent of individuals who get COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cThose individuals can isolate and stay home. If they develop more advanced symptoms, they should call their doctor.\u201d\nWooten and Dr. Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., the medical director of the County\u2019s Epidemiology and Immunization Branch, said that 80% recover without incident and their situations would not be changed by being tested. They said coronavirus testing should be reserved for the smaller percentage of individuals who present with severe symptoms and are hospitalized.\nGovernor\u2019s Order\nSupervisor Nathan Fletcher said the County continues working with the state to gain a better understanding of the Governor\u2019s detailed order. Newsom\u2019s order said everyone had to stay home, except people in \u201cessential\u201d jobs, defined by the federal Department of Homeland Security\u2019s \u201cCritical Infrastructure Sectors.\u201d\nFletcher said those generally reflected things like police, fire, utilities, government, grocery stores, banks, hospitals, transit systems and critical businesses like biotech.\nStaying at Home\nFletcher and the doctors said there were exceptions to the stay at home rule that allowed people to shop for groceries and essential household items, as well as engage in physical activity.\n\u201cThere are a number of things that are clear you can do,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cGo to the gas station, go to the pharmacy, go to the grocery store, go to the bank. You can go outside for a walk. You can take your family unit who you live with in your home \u2026 and go to a field or an open park for play. You can use all the technology we have to stay connected to your loved ones and friends who are around you.\u201d\nCounty Public Health Orders Remain in Place\nHowever, Fletcher and Wooten also said people \u2014 even those in essential services \u2014 had to continue to follow the public health orders:\n\nPeople are encouraged not to gather in groups of any size unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\nDay care must be limited to groups of up to 10 children in the same room and must remain in the same group each day with the same staff person.\nPeople 65 years of age and older, or anyone who has a chronic underlying condition or who is immunocompromised, should stay home.\nHospitals must conserve resources and delay non-emergency surgeries and elective procedures.\n\nBusiness ordered closed include:\n\nBars and adult-entertainment establishments that serve alcohol and not food;\nRestaurants must close dining-areas, but may serve food for take-out, drive-through, or delivery;\nSchools; and\nGyms and fitness centers.\n\nSocial Distancing to Flatten the Curve \nGov. Newsom\u2019s order came as public health officials around the globe have been urging people to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of the novel coronavirus by staying home and keeping six feet away from others. That would keep the virus from racing through populations, making everyone sick in a huge spike that could overwhelm hospitals and healthcare systems.\nPeople can practice social distancing by staying at home \u2014 parents working remotely and students taking classes on line. Businesses should also practice social distancing by keeping employees and customers at least six feet apart, if in an essential job, as well as working remotely, if possible.\nPeople can go out to get food or other essentials, assist a family member or friend, get medical attention, pick up medications, or go to work as an \u201cessential\u201d employee.\nLocal COVID-19 Cases\nThrough 5 p.m. Friday, the County total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased to 131 \u2014 up by 26 from Thursday \u2014 with no deaths.\nOf the 131 cases 110 were San Diego County residents and 10 were non-residents. Cases under federal quarantine also increased to 11, up by three from Thursday.\nEighty-three of the 131 cases were people between the ages of 20 and 49; 14 were between 50 and 59; and 32 were 60 or older. The County\u2019s daily coronavirus in San Diego webpage now also breaks down the number of cases by city and unincorporated communities.\nWhat Everyone Can Do to Minimize Chances of Getting COVID-19\nPeople can help limit the spread of infection, by taking these steps:\n\nWash your hands\u00a0often to help protect you from germs.\nUse an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. It should contain at least 60% alcohol.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.\nClean and\u00a0disinfect\u00a0frequently touched objects and surfaces.\nAvoid close contact\u00a0with people who are sick.\nIf you are sick, stay home and\u00a0keep your distance\u00a0from others to protect them from getting sick too.\nCover your mouth and nose\u00a0with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.\nPractice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.\n\nGet COVID-19 Info Via Text\nCounty residents can now receive information about the novel coronavirus via text thanks to the County COVID-19 public information text message alert system.
