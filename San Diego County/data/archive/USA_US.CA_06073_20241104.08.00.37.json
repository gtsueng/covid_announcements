But voters can still vote early today at any one of more than 200 vote centers or drop off their ballot at any of the Registrar\u2019s 150 official ballot drop boxes around the county.\nAll will be open on the final day of voting, Nov. 5, from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Any voter who is in line at a vote center or an official ballot drop box at 8 p.m. will be allowed to vote. However, no one can join the line after the 8 p.m. deadline.\nIf you\u2019re not registered to vote and want to participate in the election, you may visit any vote center to conditionally register and vote provisionally through Nov. 5.\nOnce the voter registration is processed and the Registrar\u2019s office confirms the voter did not vote elsewhere in the state, the voter registration becomes active and the provisional ballot is counted.\nIn preparation for the increased voter turnout, the Registrar\u2019s office has added more vote centers, including six super centers, equipped with additional check-in stations, voting booths, and poll workers.\nThe super centers are located in:\n\nChula Vista: MAAC Community Center, 1387 3rd Ave.\nEl Cajon: Wells Park, 1153 E.

When finished, the voter will print out the official ballot, review it, place it in a secrecy sleeve, and hand it to a poll worker to insert it in the ballot box to be counted at the Registrar\u2019s office. The ballot marking device does not store, tabulate or count any votes.\nRemember that campaigning or electioneering within 100 feet of a vote center or official ballot drop box is not allowed. This includes the visible display or audible dissemination of information that advocates for or against any candidate, measure, or proposition on the ballot. Additionally, an individual may not circulate any petitions, including those for initiatives, referenda, recall or candidate nominations.\nDon\u2019t delay!
