Dr. Zabin serves on the executive council of the California Workforce Development Board, and Jones recently prepared the \u201cHigh-Road Workforce Guide for City Climate Action,\u201d a national toolkit on workforce development for the American Cities Climate Challenge project.\n\u201cAs we transition to a decarbonized economy, we must consider how this will impact our region\u2019s workforce,\u201d said Sarah Aghassi, deputy chief administrative officer for the County\u2019s Land Use and Environment Group. \u201cThis study, combined with local labor and industry collaboration, will help ensure thoughtful policies are advanced for the Board\u2019s consideration, and that the best training opportunities are available to those most affected by this shift.\u201d\nThe report will consider the policy recommendations generated from the Decarbonization Framework pathways advanced by UC San Diego\u2019s David Victor, Ph.D., and Gordon McCord, Ph.D. \u00a0Both professors are part of the university\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals Policy Initiative, which belongs to a national coalition of experts who have laid out the path forward to reach zero carbon emissions in the United States by 2050.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. McCord is the Associate Teaching Professor and SDG Policy Initiative Director, UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy.\u00a0 Dr. Victor is professor of Innovation and Public Policy\u00a0at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210913.16.13.53"}
