You should:\n\nWear a mask indoors when in public\nGet all the vaccine doses and boosters\nStay home if you are sick and get tested\nAvoid crowded places\nTake other precautions, such as washing your hands and staying away from people who are visibly sick\n\nThe County continues to follow the California Department of Public Health\u2019s SMARTER plan, which recommends vaccination, use of masks, testing and treatment among other things.\n\u201cSan Diegans should take every precaution necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19,\u201d said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. \u201cMost San Diegans have been vaccinated, but with this virus, and with the prevalence and infectivity of the new variants, a booster is highly recommended, especially for people who are immunocompromised or have other comorbidities.\u201d\nGot COVID? Get Treatment \nIf you do get COVID-19, County health officials say treatment is available. Treatment can help prevent high-risk individuals from getting sick enough to need hospital services and even from dying from COVID.\nOral medications, in the form of pills, and monoclonal antibodies, in the form of an intravenous infusion, are available at multiple locations and community pharmacies across San Diego. Antiviral medications require a doctor\u2019s prescription and should be started within five days of developing symptoms of COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies should be given no more than seven days after the onset of symptoms.\nTo determine which treatment is best for you, talk to your doctor or health care provider, or call 2-1-1 to find a provider.\nVaccination Progress:\n\nReceived at least one shot: Over 3.0 million or 89.7% of San Diegans age six months and older are at least partially vaccinated.\nFully vaccinated: Nearly 2.65 million or 79.2%.\nBoosters administered: 1,396,563 or 57.8% of 2,418,004 eligible San Diegans.\nMore vaccination information can be found at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.\n\nDeaths:\n\n13 additional deaths were reported since the last report on July 7. The region\u2019s total is 5,370.\nOf the 13 additional deaths, four were women and nine were men. They died between May 23 and July 7, 2022; five deaths occurred in the past two weeks.\nEight of the people who died were 80 years or older, two were in their 70s, two were in their 60s and one was in their 40s.\n11 were fully vaccinated and two were not.\nAll had underlying medical conditions.\n\nCases, Case Rates and Testing:\n\n5,576 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past three days (July 11 to July 13, 2022). The region\u2019s total is now 857,182.\n12,948 cases were reported in the past week (July 7 through July 13) compared to 9,763 infections identified the previous week (June 30 through July 6).\nSan Diego County\u2019s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 43.95 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 27.01 for fully vaccinated people and 87.71 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.\n12,747 tests were reported to the County on July 9, and the percentage of new positive cases was 14.9% (Data through July 9).\nThe 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through July 9, is 14.5%.\n\nMore Information:\nData updates to the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0will be published Mondays and Thursdays around 5 p.m., with the exception of holidays.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220714.15.59.10"}
