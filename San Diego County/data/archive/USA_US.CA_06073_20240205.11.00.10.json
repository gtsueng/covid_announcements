If you don\u2019t have to leave home, don\u2019t. If you can work from home, do so.\nIf you don\u2019t have to drive, stay off the streets and out of areas that could flood.\n\u201cIf you live in a flood prone area, take necessary precautions, protect your family and property, have a plan and a go kit so you are ready,\u201d said County Emergency Services Director Jeff Toney.\nOther Tips To Stay Safe\n\nDo not walk, swim or drive through flood waters.\u202fTurn Around. Don\u2019t Drown!\nStay informed:\u00a0Monitor the weather and the news.\nIf you haven\u2019t already, register your cell phone to receive alerts.\nGet local updates at\u00a0AlertSanDiego.org, download the County emergency app to receive alerts, follow the County on social media and listen to local alerting systems for current emergency information and instructions regarding flooding.\nEvacuate immediately if told\u00a0to evacuate or if you feel unsafe.

Only get on the roof if necessary and once there signal for help. Do not climb into a closed attic to avoid getting trapped by rising floodwater.\nHave contingency plans for different times of the day, such as an emergency while some family members are at work or school.\nContact your healthcare provider if you are\u202fsick and need medical attention. Wait for further care instructions and shelter in place, if possible. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240205.11.00.10"}
