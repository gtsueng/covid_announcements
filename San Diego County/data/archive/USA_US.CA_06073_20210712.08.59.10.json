In 2015, Live Oak County Park became the first in the County\u2019s parks system to add an off-leash dog park, a 3,000 square-foot area with fencing, gates, tables, benches and pet waste stations where pets can frolic with their owners and other dogs.\nCounty Parks and Recreation staff have been preparing the park for its \u201cCentennial+1\u201d celebration for the past year, adding new benches, replacing walkways, installing exercise equipment, improving the park\u2019s restrooms, restoring two concrete tables that date back to the park\u2019s opening and planting more than 100 additional native trees and shrubs.\nThe party\u2019s schedule of events includes:\n\n10 a.m. \u201cPeeps and Pooches\u201d walk\n11:30 a.m. \u201cJumbo Tree Planting,\u201d the planting of two 36\u201d box live oak trees (visitors can pitch in to help, or just watch)\n11:45 a.m. Live reptile demonstrations and animal touch tables\n1 p.m. Face-painting, photo booth and balloon artists will run from 1 p.m. until the movie starts.\n3:30 p.m. Raptors (birds of prey) demonstration\n5 p.m. Bounce houses, climbing wall and an inflatable obstacle course will open as pre-movie events\n7:30 p.m. Movie in the Park, \u201cToy Story 4\u201d.\n\nSo come and celebrate.
