Community voices and employees will look at County operations through an equity and racial justice lens for disparities. Their feedback and the enhanced use of data analysis will help root out systemic racism.\nThe new budget will also support new projects from the Office of Equity and Racial Justice such as the initiative designed to Uplift Boys and Men of Color.\nBehavioral Health\nThe budget also prioritizes support for behavioral health, dedicating almost $813 million overall, including increases to redesign and enhance programs and services. This also includes mobile outreach for clients reluctant to engage in traditional settings, lowering staff-to-client ratios, enhancing crisis stabilization services, and helping ensure behavioral health clients are placed at the correct level of care possibly reducing emergency room use.\nThe budget also funds $3.2 million for 23 nurses supporting the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital, which provides critical crisis stabilization and inpatient behavioral health services to some of San Diego County\u2019s most vulnerable residents, as well as additional mental health support for adults and youth involved in the justice system.\nHealth Equity\nThe COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for health equity. The recommended budget invests $226.9 million toward continued response to COVID-19 and includes diversely targeted outreach for hard-hit neighborhoods and other vulnerable populations, continued testing, treatment and tracing efforts, and meals to at-risk seniors. The budget also increases funding to help every person live the healthiest life possible. This includes 166 additional positions to meet increased demand for safety net services including the CalFresh and Medi-Cal programs, and provides extra staffing for Adult Protective Services, In-Home Supportive Services and Child Welfare Services.\nEconomic Opportunity\nThe new budget along with an anticipated allocation of $650 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding is focused on economic recovery. The funding will provide senior and youth services, small business stimulus funds, permit fee waivers for the events industry, expanded broadband access, infrastructure, child care subsidies, food assistance and mental health services.\nHomelessness\nThe budget calls for new ways to make progress on this critical issue, including the creation of a\u00a0Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities\u00a0to streamline operations that are spread across several County agencies. The budget also includes 19 new positions and a $2.5 million increase for Community Care Coordination programs to support veterans, youth and high-need individuals with housing and other assistance. Separately, the Board of Supervisors has created a framework for the approximately $650 million to be received through the American Rescue Plan Act with $85 million currently earmarked for services to support those who are homeless.\nHousing Accessibility and Affordability\nThe federal allocation of $107 million will continue offering rental assistance through the Emergency Rental Assistance Program. The budget also includes increased funding for the CalWORKs Housing Support program to help families in need find and retain permanent housing and $2.7 million to encourage development of Accessory Dwelling Units, or ADUs, by waiving permit and impact fees and offering pre-approved plans to save time and cost.\nEnvironmental Protection\nThe budget calls for $104.5 million for environmental protection and includes reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, planting trees, acquiring at least 500 acres of land for open space, protecting water quality and agriculture, and diverting waste from landfills. Funding will also broaden the Environmental Justice Element in the County\u2019s General Plan to reduce pollution exposure and promote public facilities, food access, safe and sanitary homes, and physical activities in underserved communities.\nGovernment Transparency\nThe budget provides resources to support a new subcommittee to enhance accessibility and open government within County operations that includes engaging the public in the County budget and Board of Supervisors meetings. The subcommittee will also review and assess a Public Records Act portal, accessing archived public records and the County\u2019s email retention policy.\nCommunity Investments\nThe budget calls for $279.6 million in capital projects to improve communities throughout the region. This includes a new Otay Mesa Fire Station, new Casa De Oro Library and Julian Library Community Room, and more than $70 million for new parks, trails and recreational areas to enjoy the outdoors and preserve open space.\nBudget Timeline and How to Comment\nThe public can watch budget presentations by several County departments to the Board of Supervisors on Wednesday, May 26 and Thursday, May 27.\nBudget\u00a0hearings will begin\u00a0at 9 a.m. on Monday, June 14.
