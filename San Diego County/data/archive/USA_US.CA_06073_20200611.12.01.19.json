All patients had to be hospitalized.\n\u201cWhile our community is understandably focused on COVID-19, it is important to remember that lung injury from vaping is still a major public health concern,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cPeople who vape, especially those using THC-containing products, are urged to stop.\u201d\nIn January, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted to restrict the sale of flavored smoking products and e-cigarette and vaping devices in the County\u2019s unincorporated areas. These restrictions were proposed as a response to the e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury cases in the county and across the county. Enforcement of these restrictions will begin July 1.\nTHC containing e-cigarette or vaping products, particularly obtained from informal sources, are linked to most e-cigarette or vaping, lung injury cases. Vitamin E acetate has also been strongly linked to the outbreak and has been found in product samples from patients and in-patient lung fluid samples.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people not use THC-containing e-cigarettes or vaping products obtained from informal sources such as friends, family, pop-up shops or online sellers. Additionally, the CDC says that youth, young adults, or pregnant women should never use e-cigarette or vaping products.\nFor more information about lung injury associated with e-cigarettes or vaping visit the County EVALI webpage, the CDPH Tobacco Free California webpage or the CDC EVALI outbreak webpage.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200611.12.01.19"}
