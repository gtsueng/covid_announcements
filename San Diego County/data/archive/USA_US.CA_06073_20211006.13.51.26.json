Their discussion also included the accuracy of COVID-19 tests, the safety of the vaccines, the usefulness of masks, the efficacy of treatment options, and other issues that came up at Board of Supervisors meetings.\nCounty of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency staff are now tracking COVID-19 misinformation shared during public comment following novel coronavirus presentations to the Board of Supervisors.\nHHSA staff have been in the forefront of promoting accurate information on COVID-19 throughout the pandemic, but efforts to specifically target COVID-19 misinformation began after the Board adopted a new policy, at Chair Nathan Fletcher\u2019s request, declaring misinformation a public health crisis.\nIn August, San Diego County became the first jurisdiction in the United States to declare health misinformation a public health crisis, and others have since followed.\nThe County also has launched a new website to debunk common false claims about COVID-19 and educate people on where to find credible medical information sources\nA video of the virtual event is available on the coronavirus-sd.com website. More virtual panels are expected to take place after future Board of Supervisors meeting where a COVID-19 update is provided by County staff.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211006.13.51.26"}
