All the organizations must still sign contracts to start their projects; seven of the projects must still receive final approval from the California Air Resources Board. The organizations are reimbursed once their projects are completed.\nDistrict officials estimate that if all 138 selected projects are completed they would improve local air quality over their lifetime by preventing the emission of 562.5 tons of nitrogen engine emissions (NOx), 103.5 tons of Reactive Organic Gases (ROG) that affect ozone production; and 26.1 tons of diesel particulate matter (PM), small particles of carbon like soot.\nA list of the selected projects can be seen on the District\u2019s website.\nMost of the grant money, roughly $14.3 million, is targeted to help the County\u2019s Portside Environmental Justice Neighborhood communities and projects from other state-designated disadvantaged communities. Those include the Portside communities of Barrio Logan, Logan Heights, Sherman Heights and western National City, and El Cajon and San Ysidro.\nThe Portside Environmental Justice Neighborhood was one of the first 10 such neighborhoods to be selected by the California Air Resources Board to be part of its Community Air Protection Program. That program provides special funding for neighborhoods that are disproportionately harmed by air pollution because they\u2019re near ports, shipping, freeways, rail yards, freight, warehouses and industries. The Air Resources Board created its program in response to California\u2019s 2017 passage of Assembly Bill 617, which aimed to help local communities threatened the most by air pollution.\nSome of the selected Portside and disadvantaged communities\u2019 projects include truck, school bus, port equipment and marine replacements.\nThe remaining $6.98 million in grants come from a mixture of state air quality improvement funds and will primarily be spent to upgrade off-road vehicles, agricultural equipment and marine equipment for 36 organizations.\nFor more information about the Air Pollution Control District go to its website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200812.10.30.39"}
