Collaboration like this demonstrates the strength and impact between state and local municipalities. As we pivot to recovery, I remain committed to bringing resources to our community.\u201d\nThe California Office of Emergency Services called Board Chairwoman Nora Vargas with the news Saturday afternoon.\n\u201cThese funds will help us rebuild vital infrastructure damaged by the Jan. 22 storm,\u201d said Chairwoman Vargas. \u201cThey will help the County and other governments in the region recover from and withstand future flooding emergencies.\u201d\nThe County continues to encourage residents and businesses to fill out a voluntary online damage assessment survey.\u00a0Completing the form will assist the County of San Diego with collecting damage information related to the storm. Completing the form does\u00a0not\u00a0guarantee that you will be eligible to receive any disaster relief assistance and is\u00a0not\u00a0a substitution for filing a claim with your insurance.\nThose impacted by the storm can also get support and resources at the County Local Assistance Center opening Sunday at the Spring Valley Library located at 836 Kempton Street. Flood victims can walk in without an appointment from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Sunday and 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Wednesday. The center will act as a one-stop shop for residents who need information on how to recover from the damaging storms. Additional storm recovery information and updates are available on the County recovery website.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240127.16.16.02"}
