People who would like to learn more or share their thoughts on how the County can better serve children and families can register to attend here.\n\u201cThis change comes as a natural progression in our continuous effort to pursue equity and the best outcomes for children and families,\u201d said Kim Giardina, director of the Child and Family Well-Being Department. \u201cWe hope to hear from families across the county on how we can best support them years into the future.\u201d\nThe change was adopted unanimously by the County of San Diego Board of Supervisors in February. The department will focus efforts and budget on child and family strengthening programs and community partnerships to provide a more holistic approach.\nThe new department includes the Office of Child and Family Strengthening, made up of First 5 San Diego and other prevention and strengthening services including the regional coordination of the local childcare system. It will also include the Office of Child Safety, which will continue to provide all services currently administered through Child Welfare Services. The Child and Family Strengthening Advisory Board will oversee the overarching organizational change and monitor the department\u2019s work.\nThe new Child and Family Well-Being Department will begin this multi-year transition in July 2023. More information is available on the department\u2019s website and in this article about its approval.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230612.14.37.16"}
