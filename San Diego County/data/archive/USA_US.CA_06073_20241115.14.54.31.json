It asks about physical and mental health effects, health services used and medical history. Pet health is also included in the survey.\u202f\u00a0\nThe ACE survey is available online and takes about 20 minutes to complete. Parents or guardians should complete the survey for themselves and each of their children under 18 years old. For older adults and others who need assistance, call (800) 339-4661 to complete the survey over the phone.\u00a0\nThe County\u202fopened the ACE survey\u202fon Oct. 21. in partnership with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry which is a federal public health agency within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \u00a0\nCounty teams have been doing outreach at community events, through social media and newsletters, and with its partners in schools, businesses, health centers and community organizations.\u00a0\nThe ACE survey followed the CDC\u2019s\u202fCommunity Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response or CASPER, a household survey focused on the Imperial Beach and Nestor communities that took place the weekend of Oct. 17.\u202f\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241115.14.54.31"}
