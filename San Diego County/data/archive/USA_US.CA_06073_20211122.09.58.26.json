Meats, poultry and fish should be defrosted in the refrigerator. (If it\u2019s a big turkey, for at least 24 hours for every five pounds in weight.)\n\nAnswer: D, of course. Using the refrigerator to thaw slowly and evenly is the best, safest way to defrost any meat. Because bacteria can grow exponentially at room temperatures.\u00a0 Note: The United States Department of Agriculture says that you can also thaw meats in cold water. But \u2014 and this is important \u2014 the water must be cold, under 40 degrees, and should be changed every 30 minutes to keep it cold. Thawing in the fridge is easier!\nHow often should you wash your hands and cutting boards when preparing food?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wash your hands and cutting boards. Just wipe them off on your shirt or pants.\nBefore you start cooking.\nAfter you pet the dog. The cat. The gerbil. Or pick up the kids.\nIf you sneeze, blow your nose or have to run to the restroom.\nThe answer is everything except answer A, but mainly, \u201cOFTEN!\u201d\n\nAnswer: Definitely E. (PLEASE tell me you did NOT answer \u201cA.\u201d) You should wash your hands and cutting boards before and after everything in B, C and D. Handwashing is always a key part of safe cooking. And let\u2019s face it, as we continue to fight COVID-19, it\u2019s important to wash your hands even if you\u2019re not cooking! So break out that soap and do it. Harmful bacteria, from E. coli to salmonella and staphylococcus aureus, as well as viruses, can be removed from people\u2019s hands through\u00a0proper handwashing.\nHere are just a few other things you should wash your hands after doing: coughing, blowing your nose, using the restroom handling money, eating, drinking, smoking and handling or preparing raw food.\nShould you rinse off fruits and vegetables?\n\nNah. If they look clean they\u2019re good.\nWhy? The supermarket washes them, right?\nNo way! Fruits and vegetables are always better when they\u2019re a little crunchy.\nYes. You should rinse fruits and vegetables with cold water to remove lingering dirt that can carry bacteria.\n\nAnswer: Absolutely D. Rinsing with cold water cleans off dirt and other contaminants. But don\u2019t wash them with detergents or soap, even dishwashing soap. You could end up eating residues from those cleaners if they\u2019re absorbed by fruits and vegetables.\nWhy should you keep raw meats and meat products separated from fruits and vegetables when cutting them up or preparing them?\n\nYou know, meats and fruits and vegetables just don\u2019t like each other. Last thing you need on Thanksgiving is a food fight.\nVeggies can make your meat taste weird. Just. Weird.\nBecause raw meats, meat products and blood can carry bacteria like E. coli and salmonella that can contaminate fruits and vegetables \u2014 and make people sick.\nYou do not have to. Juice from meats is called \u201cmarinade.\u201d\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is C. (If you said D \u2014 you should seriously think about staying out of the kitchen.) Cross-contamination is one of the most common causes of food-borne illness, according to the USDA. That is, the transfer of harmful bacteria from one food, particularly raw meats, poultry and shellfish to other foods. When preparing food, you need to keep raw meats and their juices away from fruits and vegetables\u00a0and\u00a0all ready-to-eat foods.\nIf you can, use separate cutting boards for meats and produce. If you can\u2019t use separate cutting boards, wash yours with hot, soapy water after using them on raw meats and before using them to cut fruits and vegetables!\nWhat is the Danger Zone? And what does it have to do with Thanksgiving dinner?\n\nAll you people from the 1980s, stand up! It\u2019s from Top Gun! Tom Cruise, Kenny Loggins!\u00a0 \u201cHighway to the DANGER ZONE! Riiiide into the DANGER ZONE!\u201d \nIt\u2019s that toy-strewn, carpet-rippled, child-filled distance you must navigate to get the Thanksgiving food from your kitchen to the table, without dropping everything!\nIt\u2019s the range of temperatures between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 the temperatures where bacteria can grow like crazy in foods, doubling in number in as little as 20 minutes.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is C. We love Top Gun too. But the real \u201cDanger Zone\u201d is the range of temperature between 40 degrees and 140 degrees Fahrenheit that allows bacteria to breed exponentially \u2014 not a good thing. If hot foods cool or cold foods heat up enough to enter that zone, your food can become a bacteria-fest. And you can end up getting sick. So keep hot foods safely heated with chafing dishes, preheated steam tables, warming trays, slow cookers and ovens. Place cold foods in containers on ice, or in the fridge. And refrigerate leftovers as soon as you can, but definitely within two hours.\nAnd finally, we end with an age-old bonus question:\nIs the \u201cfive-second rule\u201d real? Can you eat something you\u2019ve dropped on the floor if you pick it up in less than five seconds?\n\nOf course it\u2019s real. Just pick it up quick and blow on it. Nothing can contaminate your food in less than five seconds. My dogs eat everything off the floor and I\u2019ve never seen them get sick.\nNo, no no. It\u2019s not real. You really shouldn\u2019t eat anything you\u2019ve dropped on floor.\n\nAnswer: B. It\u2019s OK for the dog to eat food that\u2019s fallen to the ground but it\u2019s not safe for people. Truth is, almost any contact is long enough for food to be contaminated by bacteria that can be found on the ground or in your house. According to research conducted by Rutgers University, bacteria can transfer from a surface to food in less than a second!\nSo there you have it. Now you\u2019re an expert. But if you\u2019re still interested, you can get more information about food safety tips at FoodSafety.gov\u2019s \u201cFood Safety by Types of Food\u201d webpage, or by calling the USDA\u2019s Meat and Poultry hotline at 1-888-674-6854.\nBe safe. Cook safe. And have a great Thanksgiving!\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211122.09.58.26"}
