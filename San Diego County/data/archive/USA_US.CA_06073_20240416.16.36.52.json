Oysters processed by JBR (KR 15 SP) in Tongyeongsi, Republic of Korea on 11/27/2023, 1/4/2024 and 2/15/2024 with lot numbers B231126, B240103 and B240214 should not be consumed. The County of San Diego is working with the California Department of Public Health to identify other potential retailers in our region.\u00a0\nThese items may be labeled \u201cAmazing Sea Brand.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIf you have consumed these oysters and feel ill, it is important to see your doctor for evaluation,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County Public Health Officer. \u201cIf you or someone you live with is sick with norovirus, it is important to wash your hands often and clean common areas to prevent spreading the infection.\u201d\u00a0\nThis comes four months after County of San Diego health officials linked 41 confirmed and probable cases of norovirus to raw oysters imported from a specific harvest location in Northwest Mexico.\u00a0\nPeople infected with norovirus generally develop nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever and body aches approximately 12 to 48 hours after consuming contaminated foods. The illness typically lasts for one to three days. The vomiting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration requiring medical attention, especially in young children, older adults and people with other illnesses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe County\u2019s Epidemiology Program and Department of Environmental Health and Quality are working\u202fclosely with California Department of Public Health,\u202fincluding\u202fthe\u202fShellfish Program,\u202fto continue\u202finvestigating\u202fillnesses\u202fassociated with oysters.\u202f\u00a0\u00a0\nTo report illness to the County after dining out or purchasing from wholesale food locations call (858) 505-6814, or email fhdepi@sdcounty.ca.gov.\nMore information\u202fon\u202fseafood and shellfish safety\u202fis available here, for general information on norovirus click here, and information on how to prevent the spread of norovirus at home click here.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240416.16.36.52"}
