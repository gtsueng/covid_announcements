When finished, the voter will print out the official ballot, review it and hand it to a poll worker to insert it in the ballot box to be counted at the Registrar\u2019s office. The ballot marking device does not store, tabulate or count any votes.\nRemember that campaigning or electioneering within 100 feet of a vote center or official ballot drop box is not allowed. This includes the visible display or audible dissemination of information that advocates for or against any candidate or measure on the ballot. Additionally, an individual may not circulate any petitions, including those for initiatives, referenda, recall or candidate nominations.\nDon\u2019t delay! If you have been holding onto your ballot, act now. You also have the option to vote from the comfort of your home.
