They meet people where they are to provide person-centered service with special attention to inclusion, diversity and equity.\nThroughout the pandemic, County nurses committed countless hours to the frontlines of the COVID-19 response, offering exceptional care and courageous leadership. They interacted with vulnerable populations including older adults, children and people experiencing homelessness. They ensured a rapid and equitable response in high-risk communities. They adapted to changing protocols and solved problems with innovation and perseverance.\nThe efforts of County nurses played a big part in the region reaching nearly 94% of its population having received at least one COVID-19 vaccination, placing San Diego among the top 10 counties in California.\nThe County thanks its nurses for their unwavering commitment to the public\u2019s health and well-being, for their hard work and compassion for all, and for their mission to ensure a healthier tomorrow.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220512.14.39.48"}
