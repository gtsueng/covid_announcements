Currently, the walk-up clinic requires appointments and has the capacity to administer 500 doses initially. It can ramp up to 1,000 each day.\nBy this weekend, no appointments will be required, with 10 percent of the shots set aside for residents of the 92113, 92102 and 92114 ZIP codes who are contacted by community health workers as part of Project SAVE (Scheduling Assistance for Vaccine Equity). Project SAVE is part of the County\u2019s efforts to equitably distribute the COVID-19 vaccine.\nFor details on groups currently eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccination opportunities, visit\u00a0www.vaccinationsuperstation.com.\nVaccination Progress:\n\nMore than 1.83 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to the region, and nearly 1.67 million have been logged as administered. This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.\nOf those vaccinated to date, nearly 560,000 County residents, or 20.8% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nOverall, more than 921,000 County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That\u2019s 34.3% of those eligible.\nThose receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s vaccination dashboard.
