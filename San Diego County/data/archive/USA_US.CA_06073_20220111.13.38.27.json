The so-called \u201cghost guns\u201d are a problem in the community because they can\u2019t be traced and are often sold to people restricted from owning a weapon.\nThe new ordinance prohibits possessing, purchasing, selling, transferring, receiving, or transporting non-serialized firearms or non-serialized parts for guns such as frames and receivers.\nBoard Chair Nathan Fletcher expanded on a suggestion by Supervisor Jim Desmond to collect data on gun violence in an annual report. Supervisors Joel Anderson and Desmond voted against the ordinance.\nIf a second reading of the ordinance is approved on January 25, the new law would take effect in February 2022, but several sections of the ordinance may not be immediately enforced to allow time for people with existing items to dispose of those guns and parts.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220111.13.38.27"}
