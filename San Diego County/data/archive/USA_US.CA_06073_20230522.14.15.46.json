The alarms can offer notification when a child or pet falls into a pool. The alarms will be available to households in the San Diego County or Deer Springs Fire Protection Districts.\nMore children ages 1-4 die from drowning than any other cause. As valuable as the device itself, is the education that will be provided by County Fire personnel at the time of delivery and install. Fire staff will teach the household best practices to prevent drowning, including the basics of swimming and water safety, supervising closely, installing fences that fully enclose pools, and for added measure, installing a pool alarm. As a last resort, knowing CPR could save a life. County Fire can help with this too! Interested individuals will be referred to any one of County Fire\u2019s free CPR courses in the community.\nTo apply for a pool alarm, visit the San Diego County Fire website.\nSee the map on this webpage to help you determine if your area is eligible.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230522.14.15.46"}
