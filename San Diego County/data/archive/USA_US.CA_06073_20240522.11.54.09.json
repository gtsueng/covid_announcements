The Board of Supervisors approved spending $1.2 million to buy 222 acres adjacent to the existing Mount Olympus County Preserve.\nThe additional acres expand the Mount Olympus County Preserve to more than 1,400 acres, reducing greenhouse gas emissions to support the County\u2019s Climate Action Plan.\nCounty Parks department officials said the land fits into the County\u2019s Multiple Species Conservation Program (MSCP). The program focuses on balancing the protection of plant and animal species with recreation, development and agricultural activities in the region.\nSome of the species protected by the program include the coastal California gnatcatcher, San Diego horned lizard, golden eagle, mule deer, and mountain lion.\nWhile the 222 acres were added to the North County area, there has also been progress in the South County area.\nIn 2023, 411 acres were added to the South County Subarea, bringing the total land conserved by the County and its partners up to 80,519 acres, or 82% of the 98,379-acre conservation goal.\nCompared to the prior year, acres added in 2023 represent a 1% increase to the overall conservation goal.\nThe Department of Parks and Recreation looks at many factors when considering obtaining open space land, including biology, connectivity, accessibility and value.\nFor more information, visit the MSCP webpage.\n\u00a0\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240522.11.54.09"}
