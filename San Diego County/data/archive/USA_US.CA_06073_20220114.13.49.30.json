They are an active breed that are always up for adventure. They need daily exercise and activities otherwise they might find other ways to entertain themselves that could make for some mischief and owner drama. They also need regular brushing to reduce shedding and keep their coats looking fabulous.\n\u201cSometimes people buy pets based on their looks and may not understand the needs of the breed, then become overwhelmed or frustrated,\u201d said Animal Service Director Kelly Campbell. \u201cHuskies can be wonderful dogs for the owners who are prepared for them.\u201d\nDuring the month of January, adoption fees are waived for all adult dogs, even non huskies, at both the Bonita shelter and the Carlsbad shelter.\nMeet this season\u2019s husky cast of characters.\nBlu Star is a year-old neutered male who keeps one ear up for praise and one down to all the haters.
