In 2014, the office issued\u00a0266 licenses and performed 242 ceremonies.\nValentine\u2019s Day wedding appointments this year were booked days in advance, but those who made last minute decisions to tie the knot could still get married. Walk-ins were welcome at the ARCC\u2019s office downtown.\nTwenty couples also found themselves the happy recipients of a free marriage license and ceremony package.\nARCC partnered with the Larry Himmel Neighborhood Foundation to\u00a0cover the costs. Radio Channel 93.3 gave away ten of the donated wedding packages on their morning show that were good for 90-days. The neighborhood foundation treated the first ten wedding couples at the County Administration Center with free weddings, flowers and chocolates.\nThe ARCC\u2019s current yearly average for marriage licenses comes to nearly 25,000. For ceremonies, the ARCC reports more than 12,000 ceremonies. Half of customers who request a marriage license also hold their wedding ceremonies at the ARCC\u2019s office.\nFor more information on how to get a marriage license or reserve a date for a civil wedding ceremony, visit the\u00a0Marriage\u00a0License & Civil Ceremony website.\nSee some of the Valentine\u2019s Day newlyweds or couples getting their marriage license at the County Administration Center below.\n  Nancy & AiraEbony & MichaelMayra & FernandoJen & BradLilly & FridelGriselda & ZaurindianaAlmaty & HectorBethany & ForrestMaria & EduardoDesirae & JoshuaNicole & AaronShayan & Sarvnaz  \n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250214.17.27.50"}
