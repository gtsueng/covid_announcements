People should use \u201cwet-cleaning\u201d methods instead, to keep from potentially breathing in the virus and getting sick.\nIt is not uncommon to find hantavirus in wild rodents in San Diego County. This is the tenth detection this year and there were there were 25 detections in 2020.\nThe virus can cause deadly infections in people and there is no vaccine or cure. However people are rarely exposed to it because wild rodents tend to live away from people.\u00a0People can be exposed to hantavirus when wild rodents shed the virus in their urine, feces and saliva, the matter dries, is stirred into the air and people breathe it in.\nBecause of that, County officials said people should never sweep or vacuum up if they find rodent nests or signs of rodents in their homes. If people must clean they should use \u201cwet cleaning\u201d methods \u2014 using bleach, disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags.\nHere are tips for people to prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, and how to use wet-cleaning methods.\nAvoid Exposure to Hantavirus\n\nSeal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.\nEliminate rodent infestations immediately.\nAvoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.\nClean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.\n\nUse \u201cWet-cleaning\u201d Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus\n\nDo not sweep or vacuum infested areas.\nVentilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.\nUse rubber gloves.
