The surfacing of the park\u2019s existing playground was also upgraded. The park already provided families in the neighborhood with a children\u2019s playground, basketball courts, restrooms and a community room.\n\u201cWith new acreage and more equitable amenities and access, Lincoln Acres County Park has become a more desirable, prominent place for real community connection,\u201d Supervisor Vargas said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we continue to prioritize projects like this; projects that support walkable and inclusive play spaces for small, densely populated communities like Lincoln Acres.\u201d\nVargas, National City Fire Chief Frank Parra and County Parks Director Brian Albright opened Saturday\u2019s event with a brief presentation, followed by an outdoor open house for a couple hundred members of the public who attended the event.\nFormer County Supervisor Greg Cox, who represented the area before Supervisor Vargas, also attended. The presentation included a dedication of a memorial plaque honoring the Lower Sweetwater Fire Protection District.\nThe open house included fun things for all ages, including animal \u201ctouch tables\u201d with skulls, animal skins and live animals, an instructor-led exercise station, a planting workshop, plant-pot painting, photo opportunities with a National City fire engine. The County\u2019s Live WoW (Well on Wheels) resource bus was also at the event, in addition to sheriff\u2019s officials and local authors of a \u201cLincoln Acres Centennial Book.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210828.14.56.13"}
