The application period will be open for three weeks and will be extended if necessary.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve received assistance through a past rent or utility assistance program, you may still apply for the outstanding rent or utilities that have not been covered,\u201d Estrella said.\nThe County\u2019s Emergency Rental Assistance Program will assist San Diego residents countywide, except for those residing in the cities of San Diego and Chula Vista. Residents of San Diego and Chula Vista can visit\u00a0http://www.ERAPSanDiego.org\u00a0for information about rental assistance programs in those cities.\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 10.8 cases per 100,000 residents (as of March 2) and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 4.2%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier. While the testing positivity rate for the County qualifies it for Tier 3, the state uses the most restrictive metric \u2013 in this case the adjusted case rate \u2013 and assigns counties to that tier. Therefore, the County remains in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 6% and is in the Red Tier or Tier 2. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance to a less restrictive tier.\nThe California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, March. 9.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nNo new community outbreaks were confirmed March 1.\nIn the past seven days (Feb. 23 through March 1), 29 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n9,303 tests were reported to the County on March 1, and the percentage of new positive cases was 4%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 3.8%. Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 13,333.\n\nCases, Hospitalizations and ICU Admissions:\n\n376 cases were reported to the County on March 1. The region\u2019s total is now 261,001.\n13,162 or 5% of all cases have required hospitalization.\n1,598 or 0.6% of all cases and 12.1% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\n14 new COVID-19 deaths were reported March 1. The region\u2019s total is 3,317.\nEight men and six women died between Jan. 21 and Feb. 28.\nOf the 14 deaths reported March 1, four people who died were 80 years or older, four were in their 70s, two were in their 60s and three were in their 50s and one was in their 40s.\n12 had underlying medical conditions, one did not and one had medical history pending.\n\nMore Information:\nThe more detailed data summaries found on the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0are updated around 5 p.m. daily.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210302.17.01.26"}
