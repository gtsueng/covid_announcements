It is a framework that focuses on ten priority areas for designing age-friendly and dementia-friendly communities.\u201d\u00a0\nThe\u202fAging Roadmap, which launched in 2019, outlines the region\u2019s efforts to make sure the needs of older adults are met when it comes to care and support, affordable housing, accessible transportation and opportunities to work and volunteer.\u202f\u00a0\nSeveral County programs help older adults stay connected and provide activities for well-being including:\u202f\u00a0\n\nMeals and Senior Dining: hot, nutritious meals are served for people over 60 years old weekly at nearly 30 locations around the region.
