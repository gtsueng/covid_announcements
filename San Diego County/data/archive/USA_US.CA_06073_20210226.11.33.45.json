He has conducted more than 5,000 autopsies, served as an autopsy supervisor for more than 800 cases, testified in hundreds of court proceedings, and he has been published more than a dozen times in medical journals and forensic/pathology publications\nCampman said the San Diego Medical Examiner\u2019s Office faced several challenges last year, not just with COVID-19 but also with fentanyl-related deaths and overall case volume.\n\u201cWe had initial jurisdiction over about 41% of the more than 25,000 deaths registered in San Diego County in 2020 and ended up transporting about 14% of those decedents back to the facility for examination to determine cause of death,\u201d said Campman. \u201cLast year\u2019s case volume was the greatest we\u2019ve ever investigated at 3,853.\u201d\nIn addition to COVID, Campman said the office helps ensure county residents are living safely by providing important data to government officials on societal issues such as the rise in fentanyl-related cases, the opioid epidemic, methamphetamine abuse, suicides, child fatalities and homeless deaths. Campman said this data can then be used to help San Diego County government agencies implement programs to address current trends and to target the most vulnerable residents.\n\u201cThe department is here for the residents of the county,\u201d said Campman. \u201cEvery member of the Medical Examiner\u2019s staff is here because they\u2019ve chosen to serve in this capacity and values the unique ways that we can help people.\u201d\nCampman is a graduate of Loyola Marymount University and Creighton University School of Medicine and completed his residency at UC Davis Medical Center Dept of Pathology and his fellowship through UC Davis at the Sacramento County Coroner\u2019s Office.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210226.11.33.45"}
