The transition, which took place July 1, 2023, began with a promise to improve service levels for the desert community\u2019s 4,000 residents. It also included welcoming 14 Borrego Springs firefighters to the CAL FIRE/San Diego Fire team. San Diego County Fire appointed a Desert Battalion Chief to lead the Borrego Fire station and added a new fire engine, paramedic ambulance and a third firefighter on the engine to ensure equitable daily staffing. Additionally, the team has begun renovating both the fire station and an aging department administration building while considering options for \u00a0\u00a0the timing and location of a new fire station to better serve community needs.\n\u201cEnsuring that Borrego Springs has the best possible fire and medical services is crucial for the safety and well-being of our residents,\u201d said Supervisor Jim Desmond. \u201cThis transition has significantly enhanced our community\u2019s emergency response capabilities, and I\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve made.\u201d\nIn efforts to engage and empower the community, County Fire conducted training sessions for local residents. These sessions covered essential skills such as Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), automated external defibrillator (AED) usage, home fire preparedness, earthquake response tactics, overdose intervention, and wildfire readiness.\n\u201cThis is a great example of two groups coming together to better serve our community,\u201d said Andrew Strong, Public Safety Interim Deputy Chief Administrative Officer. \u201cBorrego Springs gains more firefighters, more paramedics and updated equipment to promote safety and well-being for our residents.\u201d\n\u201cCounty Fire and CAL FIRE remain committed to serving and safeguarding the people of Borrego Springs and protecting the property and resources across San Diego County and the State,\u201d County Fire/CAL FIRE San Diego Chief Tony Mecham said. \u201cOur ongoing efforts include plans to replace the fire station, ensuring continued long-term improvements in the community.\u201d\nBorrego Springs resident Gloria Hoff said she and her husband appreciate everything that CAL FIRE/San Diego County Fire have done, especially the informative LISTOS/Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) trainings that hone in on the importance of preparedness, use of equipment and resources.\n\u201cThese offerings are critical in our small rural isolated community with limited resources.\u00a0 We are very grateful for these classes and look forward to the next class covering Fentanyl and Narcan.\u00a0 Yet another critical subject for all of us here and elsewhere,\u201d said Hoff.\nCounty Fire works to provide comprehensive fire protection and emergency medical services effectively and efficiently across more than 1.5 million acres of unincorporated San Diego County.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240711.15.58.36"}
