This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.\nOf those vaccinated to date, over 471,000 County residents, or 17.5% of San Diegans, 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nOverall, over 745,000 County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That\u2019s 27.7% of those eligible.\nThose receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s vaccination dashboard. For details on groups currently eligible and vaccination opportunities, visit\u00a0www.vaccinationsuperstation.com.\n\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 6.8 cases per 100,000 residents.
