If no parent, guardian or caregiver can be present, the minor will have to bring photo ID and, if under the age of 16, another adult must be present during the vaccination appointment.\nVaccination Progress:\n\nDoses delivered: More than 3.73 million.\nDoses administered: Roughly 3.25 million.\nReceived at least one shot: More than 1.75 million or 62.6% of San Diegans 12 and older.
