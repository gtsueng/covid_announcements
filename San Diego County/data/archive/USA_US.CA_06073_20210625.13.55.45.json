Throughout the pandemic, the County has focused on equity and has been reaching out to communities and populations that have vaccine hesitancy.\u201d\nThe County has reached the federal goal to vaccinate\u00a070% of San Diego County residents 12 and older, or 1,961807 people, with at least one dose.\nOverall, more than 2.16 million San Diegans have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine and more than 1.83 million are fully vaccinated.\nSan Diegans are encouraged to continue getting vaccinated to prevent getting and passing the COVID-19 virus to others.\nVaccinations continue to be available at more than 400 locations, including doctors\u2019 offices, retail pharmacies and County clinics throughout the region. Some vaccination sites will continue to offer extended hours to make it easier for San Diegans to get immunized.\n\u201cThe more people who get vaccinated, the better chance we have at ending this pandemic locally,\u201d Wooten added.\nIn addition to existing COVID-19 vaccination clinics, County partners like local municipalities, Champions for Health, UC San Diego Health, San Diego American Indian Health Center and the San Diego Black Nurses Association will be handling requests for mobile vaccination events. Organizations wishing to host a vaccination event can submit a request.\nNo-cost COVID-19 testing sites remain operational around the County.
