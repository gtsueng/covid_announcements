County Fire installs the box just on or near the front door and can only be opened by local firefighters responding to life-threatening emergencies.\nThe KnoxBoxes can either be installed on a door or on a wall next to the front door.\nThe concern about firefighters being able to gain access to their home was on Nancy Weir\u2019s mind when she called her local fire station on Palomar Mountain. Initially, she just wanted to make sure they could get past a complicated gate system used by several homes including her own. In talking to the captain, she mentioned that she is recovering from a concussion that can cause various degrees of dizziness and fainting.\n\u201cI just wanted to be sure if I was home alone with the doors locked, the fire department could easily get in without busting my door down,\u201d Weir said.\nShe said the captain came by to look at the gate and suggested she would be a perfect candidate for the residential KnoxBox program which she had not heard about. She signed up and soon enough someone from the fire station came by to install it.\n\u201cI feel a lot safer now knowing they know how to get in the gate and how to get in my house and what my issues are,\u201d Weir said. \u201cIt\u2019s all great now, not only for medical relief but we have a super high fire risk here.\u201d\nCounty Fire received a federal grant to help buy an initial 200 KnoxBoxes. The agency loans the boxes to participants to help reduce risk in their rural communities. The program launched in October and has received over 70 applicants so far, and more than 25 have been installed in communities such as Potrero, Jamul and Warner Springs. To qualify, residents must:\n\nLive in San Diego County Fire, Ramona Municipal Water District, or Deer Springs Fire Protection District coverage areas.\nBe any of the following:\n\nAt least 62 years old\nHave a disability\nNeed assistance with one or more Major Life Activity\n\n\n\nTo apply for the program or for more information, call San Diego County Fire at (858) 974-5744 or email FireCRR@sdcounty.ca.gov. People can also visit the San Diego County Fire Authority site to obtain an application and read more information on the program.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20201218.12.47.33"}
