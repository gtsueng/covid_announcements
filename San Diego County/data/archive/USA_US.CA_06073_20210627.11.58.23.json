No human contact with the bat has been reported at this time.\nIf you or someone in your family or group had contact with the bat, you are urged to contact the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency as soon as possible at (619) 692-8499.\u00a0If you did not have direct contact with the bat, such as touching or holding the animal, you are not at risk for rabies.\nThe bat was not one of the park\u2019s collection animals. It was delivered to the County on June 25 and testing confirmed the animal to be positive for rabies. There has been one other rabid bat found in San Diego County so far this year.\n\u201cHuman rabies is usually fatal without prompt post-exposure vaccine and treatment,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThere has been no reported human or animal contact with this bat, but it was found in an area where many park visitors pass by, and we want to make sure that no one had contact with it.\u201d\nRabies transmission can occur from a bat bite or if a bat\u2019s saliva comes in contact with a cut or abrasion, or with mucous membranes, such as the eyes, nose or mouth.\n\u201cPeople should always stay away from bats and other wild animals to prevent possible exposure to rabies,\u201d said Wooten. \u201cIf you see a bat, dead or alive, don\u2019t touch it.\u201d\nRabies in humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with wild, stray, and unknown domestic animals, ensuring pets are up-to-date on rabies vaccinations, and receiving prompt medical advice following animal bites and other significant exposures to potentially rabid animals. Rabies is not uncommon in wild bats in San Diego County.\nIf direct contact with a bat does occur, wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and water and get medical advice immediately.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210627.11.58.23"}
