For some, the answer may be no because they lack transportation, need additional help with medical equipment or gathering items in their home.\nStudies have shown that during a disaster, older adults or people with disabilities, or access and functional needs have added challenges when faced with evacuation. This information inspired the County Office of Emergency Services to come up with the Neighborhood Evacuation Team program in partnership with the Community Emergency Response Teams throughout the region. The teams are made up of disaster-trained volunteers who can help in their neighborhoods.\nPeople who reach out for assistance will be teamed up with a CERT member who can guide them through the process of making a plan that suits their needs, including working out transportation needs with a caregiver, neighbor or family member.\nThe County, CAL FIRE/Fire Authority, CERT and school project partners introduced the new program Wednesday at Kearny High School.\n\u201cHaving faced several major wildfires and other emergencies, some San Diego County residents have told emergency officials of the difficulty and delays they had to overcome to evacuate. This free service that is being offered through the NET program will help people who need extra help put together a plan tailored for their needs,\u201d said County Supervisor Greg Cox. \u201cOnce they have a plan in place, if asked to evacuate, it may take them 15 minutes to leave instead of 45 or 75 minutes and that could save someone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\u201cThis program fits into the national Neighbors Helping Neighbors approach that is crucial in a disaster because we know that in a major disaster, first responders will be tied up managing the threat and it could be up to 72 hours before they could send someone to assist,\u201d said Jeff Toney, director for County Emergency Services. \u201cSo, we are glad to be an impetus for this effort where neighbors check in with one another, particularly in rural areas, and especially if a neighbor may have additional needs.\u201d\nCAL FIRE/San Diego County Fire Division Chief Burke Kremensky said the firefighters looks forward to working alongside CERT members to help residents. He called the program \u201cpositive growth happening in our rural communities\u201d and said it could \u201cprove to be a lifesaving benefit to residents.\u201d\nThe pilot begins this week with information starting to go out to communities in 21 of the unincorporated areas. OES staff additionally partnered with students from Kearny High\u2019s School of Digital Media and Design to help develop and create promotional materials such as videos and graphics to be used in community outreach and on social media.
