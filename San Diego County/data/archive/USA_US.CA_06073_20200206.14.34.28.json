Order your rain barrel by Feb. 16 to pick it up from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, Feb 22, at Spring Valley\u2019s Mount Miguel High School at 8585 Blossom Lane. Order by Feb. 22 to pick your barrel up from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 29 at the Ramona Community Center at 434 Aqua Lane.\nIf you can\u2019t make either event, you can also pick up your barrel at the Solana Center\u2019s Encinitas offices at 137 N. El Camino Real from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday\u2019s through Thursdays, or from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturdays.\nCounty residents can apply for a $35 rebate that can shrink their rain barrel\u2019s cost from $90 to $55 if they get their water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California \u2014 either through the San Diego County Water Authority or its participating member agencies in San Diego County.\nIn addition, the County of San Diego is giving out its own $30 discount to residents living in unincorporated areas on the first 200 rain barrels ordered, which can shrink your final cost to just $25.\nHaving a rain barrel can let you \u201charvest\u201d rain right off your roof and use it to keep your gardens or lawns green the old-fashioned way. That can cut your water costs and even help protect our local beaches by preventing excess rain from washing pollution off our roofs and yards, and down our streets to the ocean.\nThe Ivy Rain Barrels have a locking, child-proof lid, are made of 100% recycled material, have overflow ports, protective screening to keep mosquitoes out, a \u00be-inch ball valve to connect to your garden hose or to another barrel, and they don\u2019t need pumps because they use gravity to dispense their collected rainwater.\nGetting your discounted rain barrel is as easy as one, two, three.\nOne, order your barrel. Two, apply for your rebate(s). Three, go pick up your barrel.\nOrder and buy your barrel\nGo to the\u00a0County/Solana Center\u2019s events website. Scroll halfway down the page and choose one of the three locations to pick up your rain barrel \u2014 at Spring Valley\u2019s Mount Miguel High School, the Ramona Community Center, or the Solana Center in Encinitas. Once you choose a location, you can order and pay for your rain barrel with a credit card.\nIf you live in an unincorporated community or area and not in a city, remember to check the \u201cunincorporated\u201d box to make sure you are given the County\u2019s $30 discount. The discount will be automatically applied to your purchase price when you\u2019re buying your rain barrel. Solana Center officials will double-check after your purchase to make sure you\u2019re eligible for the discount. You can\u00a0check here to see a list of eligible, ineligible and potentially eligible ZIP codes.\nYou may buy as many rain barrels as you\u2019d like, but the Metropolitan rebate and County discount are limited to two per household.\nFinally, remember that your rain barrel will not be delivered. You can pick it up at any of the three pickup locations.\nApply for your rebate(s)\n$35 rebates from the Metropolitan Water District are available within 90 days of ordering/buying your rain barrel, so as soon as you order your rain barrel go to Metropolitan\u2019s SoCalWaterSmart rain barrel rebates webpage. Rebates are available on a first-come, first-served basis. You can check out the Metropolitan Water District rebates\u2019\u00a0frequently asked questions\u00a0and\u00a0conditions\u00a0for help.\nPick up your rain barrel!\nWhen you buy your barrel(s), Rain Water Solutions will email you a confirmation of your purchase (look for the email with the subject line \u201cOrder#\u2026 confirmed\u201d). Remember to bring your confirmation email with you when you go to your chosen location to pick up your barrel. And remember to leave room in your car! Solana Center officials say that barrels fit easily in any four-door sedan or SUV and even into some two-door cars.\nFor more information, go to the Solana Center\u2019s Rain Water Solutions webpage.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200206.14.34.28"}
