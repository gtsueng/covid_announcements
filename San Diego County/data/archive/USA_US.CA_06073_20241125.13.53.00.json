This year 31 families finalized the adoption of 36 children.\nOne of those families is Raymond and Ricciee Soriano, who adopted three-year-old Parker.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep last night\u2026 This overwhelming feeling of oh my god this is really it,\u201d Raymond said.\nTissues and tears, cheers of celebration and moments of embrace throughout the event illuminated how much love surrounds these children.\n\u201cWhen we were signing our paperwork and saw his name, what his new name is going to be, that\u2019s when it just was oh my gosh, this is really happening\u2026 he\u2019s finally ours,\u201d Ricciee said of her son Parker.\nThe couple started fostering Parker when he was four months old and were overjoyed when the adoption became official.\nInformation about becoming a resource parent is available at SDCares4kids.com.\nFamily strengthening is a pillar of the 1-year-old CFWB. Focused on providing prevention and support services, the new Child and Family Well-Being Department started its transformation in July 2023, combining the First 5 Commission and what was then called Child Welfare Services.\nIn its first year of operation, the department reduced the number of children in foster care by nearly 12 percent. For children placed into foster care, 44 percent found a home with relatives, a 10 percent increase over the previous year.\nThe department continues to evolve and work with the community and experts to identify how to best serve families. This includes developing a Community Response Guide and continuing efforts related to the\u00a0Child Care Blueprint.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241125.13.53.00"}
