The tables are part of a larger renovation for the already-popular park that opened in 2014 that will ultimately add a dog park, exercise equipment, pickleball and basketball courts, and a T-ball area.\nWhile those new amenities will focus on more traditional physical activities, Saturday\u2019s tournament and new chess area showed that heading to the park can exercise people\u2019s brains too \u2014 not just their muscles.\n\u201cYou may not think of this as recreation in a traditional sense,\u201d Fletcher said, \u201cbut the benefits of playing a game that demands this type of strategic thinking can grow exponentially when you have the opportunity to play it outside, in the fresh air, and in a peaceful, social park setting.\n\u201cBy continuing to diversify offerings,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe are bringing more recreation options to more people \u2014 meeting a variety of wants and needs in the community.\u201d\nThe chess tables, including one that is ADA accessible, are located in a shaded area to keep players out of the direct sun. Chess pieces will be available to be checked out by the public on a first-come, first-served basis from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily at the Waterfront Park office. The office is located at the south entrance of the County Administration Center building.\nSaturday\u2019s tournament included three dozen youthful competitors broken into three age groups: \u201cknights\u201d aged up to 11 years old; \u201crooks,\u201d comprised of 12-14 year olds; and \u201croyals\u201d aged 15-18 years old.\nAll participants received commemorative chess board sets. Second place finishers in each category received $25 gift cards; winners in each category received a trophy and a $50 gift card.\nThe County\u2019s Department of Parks and Recreation hopes to open some of the other Waterfront Park improvements as early as spring 2022.\nFor more information about the County Parks go to the Department of Parks and Recreation website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210904.16.34.51"}
