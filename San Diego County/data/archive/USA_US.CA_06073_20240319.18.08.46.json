Once the judgment is assigned to the County for collection, the County will seek to recover money that is owed to the worker.\nOne program applicant said it\u2019s important to hold employers responsible, so they don\u2019t take wages from others.\n\u201cI\u2019m finally receiving justice for my case. The financial assistance of the Workplace Justice Program is providing me with the hard-earned money I should have received many years ago from my employer.\u201d said Sandra Cruz, program applicant.\n\u201cWhen an employer cheats a worker out of fair wages, they cannot afford to pay for their basic needs, which hurts our local economy\u2026,\u201d said County Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer. \u201cSo, our Office of Labor Standards Enforcement is now here to ensure that if these things do happen, if you are a victim, there is a place for you to go.\u201d\nThe County\u2019s Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement (OLSE) used the Workplace Justice Fund to help more than 34 workers.\nThe Good Faith Restaurant Owners Program is another way the office holds bad-faith businesses accountable.\n\u201cIn 2023, the Office of Labor Standards launched the program to combat wage theft in the restaurant industry,\u201d said OLSE Director Branden Butler. \u201cAs of March 2024, OLSE has assisted in recovering $100,000 in unpaid wages from seven restaurants in collaboration with the Labor Commissioner\u2019s office.\u201d\nAccording to the District Attorney\u2019s office, wage theft can take many forms. For example, paying less than minimum wage, not paying for overtime or not allowing for meal and rest breaks.\n\u201cWhen you think about wage theft, it is on a continuum. You start with wage theft abuses\u2026\u201d said District Attorney Summer Stephan. \u201cThen you move all the way up to labor trafficking when that wage theft and those abuses escalate to the point of being one of the most serious human rights violations of labor trafficking, that\u2019s when you add force, fraud and coercion\u2026\u201d\nThe D.A. urges people who think they have a case of labor trafficking to contact their office at 866-402-6044.\nButler said the office is also working with the Sheriff\u2019s Department to educate job seekers who have been involved in the justice system on their rights under the State\u2019s Fair Chance Act.\nThe County regularly works with both the Employee Rights Center and the State Department of Industrial Relations to advance workers\u2019 rights.\n\u201cWe are all working together, and we are very proud to see that we are, in part, the connection that brings all these resources together, all this attention together so hopefully there will be no stories like Sandra in the future,\u201d said Employee Rights Center Director Alor Calder\u00f3n.\n\u201cSo, the collaboration with OLSE, the DA\u2019s office, at least with my office here in San Diego, that is the magic,\u201d said Labor Commissioner Lilia Garc\u00eda-Brower. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly where we\u2019re able to protect the most vulnerable workers and law-abiding employers.\u201d\u2019\nAfter the event, the OLSE honored a local business with a certificate. Mujeres Brew House is a female-run and Latina-owned brewery in San Diego that was recognized for showing exceptional support for its employees.\nEmployers and workers who want more information about workers\u2019 rights or wage theft can contact the Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement at 619-531-5129.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240319.18.08.46"}
