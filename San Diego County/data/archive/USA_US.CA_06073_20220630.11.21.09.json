Prior to the remodel, customers had to go into the building, be screened by security by going through a metal detector and take the elevator to the fifth floor where the rest of the FRC was located.\n\u201cWith these improvements the County is providing easier access and faster service to our customers, most of whom are vulnerable residents without a stable place to live and who are struggling with a mental illness and/or substance use issues,\u201d said Self-Sufficiency Services Director Rick Wanne.\nSince the storefront opened about 18 months ago, it has received over 110,000 customer visits, averaging approximately 250 per day with a typical wait time of less than 15 minutes. Additionally, the FRC storefront has issued more than 24,000 electronic benefit transfer or EBT cards.\nQuickly established 18 months ago to provide in-person services to the public during COVID-19, this new way of providing walk-up, triage, and quick transaction services has proven so successful that the County is exploring plans to implement this model at the other 11 FRCs.\n\u201cWe expect this service delivery model to effectively support our customers at all locations moving forward,\u201d said Wanne.\nCurrently, there are 367,000 San Diegans receiving CalFresh benefits, 42,000 on CalWorks, 967,000 getting Medi-Cal and 3,000 receiving General Relief assistance.\nResidents can apply for Self-Sufficiency programs online, at a County Family Resource Center or via the Customer Service Call Center at (866) 262-9881.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220630.11.21.09"}
