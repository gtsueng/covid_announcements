About 10% of COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are being administered through the County.\n\u201cWe have seen low demand at several of our existing testing and vaccination sites and are therefore shifting our efforts to more of the underserved safety net approach,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThe County remains committed to providing no-cost vaccinations and testing across the region but recognize that most people now get these services elsewhere.\u201d\nChanges in the testing process have also come to the seven state-funded COVID-19 testing sites the County organizes. Individuals will now initially be administered an antigen test and wait about 15 minutes for the results to come back. If the results of the antigen test are positive, the individual is given a confirmatory PCR test, with results expected back within one day. In the meantime, they are advised to follow isolation protocol.\nFollowing are the seven locations across the County that are offering the no-cost antigen/PCR testing process.
