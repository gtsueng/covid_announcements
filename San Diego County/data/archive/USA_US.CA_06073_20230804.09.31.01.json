You can:\n\nVote in person or drop off a mail-in ballot\nVote using an accessible ballot marking device\nReceive assistance and voting materials in multiple languages\nRegister to vote or update your voter registration and vote on the same day\n\nVoters will use a touch screen to make their selections on ballot marking devices. When finished, the voter will print out the official ballot, review it and hand it to a poll worker to insert it in the ballot box to be counted at the Registrar\u2019s office. The ballot marking device does not store, tabulate or count any votes.\nRemember that campaigning or electioneering within 100 feet of a vote center or official ballot drop box is not allowed. This includes the visible display or audible dissemination of information that advocates for or against any candidate on the ballot. Additionally, an individual may not circulate any petitions, including for initiatives, referenda, recall or candidate nominations.\nVoters can still mark their ballot from home. Be sure to sign and date the return envelope, seal your completed ballot inside and return it to one of the Registrar\u2019s official ballot drop boxes or vote centers. Or return your ballot through the U.S. Postal Service as long as it\u2019s postmarked by Aug. 15.\nIf you already returned your mail ballot, you can confirm when it was received by the Registrar\u2019s office at sdvote.com.\nLearn more about voting in the District 4 special primary election at sdvote.com, or call (858) 565-5800 or toll free at (800) 696-0136.\nGet mobile updates by texting COSD D4Election to 468311.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230804.09.31.01"}
