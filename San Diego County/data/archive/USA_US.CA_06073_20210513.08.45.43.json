It was just too much.\nShe made a series of bad decisions around that time; before she knew it, she was at the Las Colinas Detention and Reentry Facility facing a possible sentence of 18 years. Her story could have stopped there, as it does for many men and women in the county who experience similar issues. Not Carapia.\nAlmost immediately after arriving at Las Colinas, Carapia said she decided the incarcerated life was not the way she wanted to live.\u00a0She credits the multiple reentry programs offered by San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department for putting her on a new path in life.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very humbling experience, and these programs actually do help,\u201d said Carapia. \u201cThey aren\u2019t here to make you fall or trip you up like many people might think. They are here to actually help you get your life back on track and have a future for yourself.\u201d\nCarapia entered the Incentive-Based Housing program just a few weeks after arriving at Las Colinas. The program allows inmates more access to reentry programs if they agree to take part in psychosocial, education, and wellness classes.\nAfter completing the housing program, Carapia took the opportunity to participate in one of the vocational programs offered at Las Colinas that helps to prepare women for reentry into society once their sentences are complete. Ms. Carapia completed nearly all the programs offered at the facility, ranging from the Beyond Anger and Violence program to working with The Old Globe theater, which she still does.\nBridget Wright, a supervisor with the Sheriff\u2019s Reentry Services Division, said that Carapia\u2019s performance in the Culinary Arts Program and interest in continuing in the field led to additional opportunities in food service.\n\u201cShe was encouraged to complete the new Kitchens for Good Management Program, and she did,\u201d said Wright. \u201cShe was actually awarded the OASIS award from instructors and staff at the Grossmont Adult Education School for being an outstanding student during her Kitchens for Good graduation last month.\u201d\nWright said, \u201cWhile the support and reentry programs are there, Ms. Carapia is doing all the hard work herself. She will now begin her 20-month apprenticeship working in restaurants, while continuing to prioritize her recovery and meeting the conditions of her mandatory supervision.\u201d\nCarapia is currently working as a cashier at Sombrero Mexican Food in the Grantville neighborhood, a local, family-owned restaurant chain. She said the skills she learned in the Culinary Arts Program will help her move up into other kitchen and restaurant management positions in the area.\n\u201cThere were times when I wanted to throw in the towel, but I saw the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d said Carapia. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy, but a lot of people are proud of me, and I\u2019m proud of myself.\u201d\nFor women leaving the justice system and returning to the community, Carapia highly recommends the reentry programs available.\u00a0Her advice for others in similar situations in the justice system is simple. She tells them not to give up on themselves, no matter what the current circumstances may be because things get better.\n\u201cWe all have battle scars from our past,\u201d said Carapia. \u201cThese services are there to help you, and they really want you to succeed and not go back to being locked up.\u201d\nDuring the almost five years she spent behind bars at Las Colinas, Ms. Carapia said in addition to the reentry programs she also found comfort in a poem that makes its\u00a0way around the facility, as well as other detention facilities in the U.S., called \u201cGod\u2019s Hotel.\u201d\n\u201cThat poem is very inspirational to me,\u201d said Ms. Carapia. \u201cIt says God put me there, even though it wasn\u2019t my choice or his choice either, but it was a place where I could focus on myself.\u201d\nYou can watch a video of Carapia participating in the Sheriff\u2019s Theater Arts program.
