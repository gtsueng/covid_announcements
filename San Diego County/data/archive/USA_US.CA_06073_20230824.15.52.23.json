The officers connect with families and students using open and honest dialogue which fosters better community understanding and relationships, she said.\nMembers of the San Diego Kiwanis Club and Old Mission Rotary assisted with distributing books and groceries from Feeding San Diego. Employees from Target volunteered to handle the grill and BBQed over 500 hot dogs for students and their families to enjoy. Additionally, youth could receive free dental exams and services from La Maestra, physicals from the County of San Diego LiveWell WOW bus, and eye exams thanks to the UCSD Eye Mobile Clinic.\nSTAR/PAL received additional funding and sponsorships from Target, BluPeak Credit Union, Richard J. Donovan and Old Mission Rotary to help put on the community event. \u00a0The San Diego Bike Coalition and the San Diego County Department of Parks and Recreation were also event community partners.\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230824.15.52.23"}
