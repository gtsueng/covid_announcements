Shelton is the first Afro-Latina in County history to serve in the role. She will start her new position June 14.\nShelton is a visionary leader who has dedicated her career to serving the community, most recently in a dual role as the County\u2019s chief financial officer and as a deputy chief administrative officer, overseeing the departments in the County\u2019s Finance and General Government group.\n\u201cEbony has the vision, the talent and the expertise to serve our residents and support working families as the Chief Administrative Officer,\u201d said Board Chairwoman Nora Vargas. \u201cShe has nearly 30 years of experience working for the County and is a native San Diegan who is committed to our communities.\u201d\nThe County\u2019s CAO is responsible for implementing the Board\u2019s policies and running the County\u2019s daily operations, including more than 20,000 employees who serve nearly 3.3 million people in the region.\nThe County provides many services across the region, such as food and restaurant inspections, beach and bay water testing, elections, social services, health programs, foster care, adult protective services and more.\nIn addition, the County provides city-type services for those who live outside of the region\u2019s 18 cities in the unincorporated area, including law enforcement and fire protection, and maintenance of parks, libraries and roads.\n\u201cI am deeply honored by the Board\u2019s approval and the opportunity to lead the County team in service of our residents,\u201d said Shelton. \u201cI am committed to driving positive change and fostering a future of prosperity, inclusivity and resilience for all in the region.\u201d\nSarah Aghassi currently serves as the interim Chief Administrative Officer. She was unanimously selected by the Board to serve as the interim during the recruitment process. Aghassi previously led the departments in the Land Use and Environment group as the deputy chief administrative officer and general manager. She has been with the County for over 18 years.\nAghassi took the role after former CAO Helen Robbins-Meyer retired in the beginning of January. She applied for the role knowing that the Interim CAO would not compete or be chosen for the permanent role. Aghassi did not apply for the permanent job as CAO.\n\u201cWe extend our sincerest gratitude to Sarah for her exemplary service as interim CAO during this critical transitional period. Sarah\u2019s dedication, leadership and unwavering commitment have been invaluable to our County organization,\u201d\u00a0said Supervisor Monica Montgomery Steppe.\nShelton began her career with the County in 1997 at the age of 19 as a payroll clerk, earning consistent promotions in various human resource and financial roles, including the director of the Office of Financial Planning where she guided financial planning policies and coordinated the creation of the County\u2019s annual multi-billion-dollar budget.\nHer leadership paved the way for her most recent position overseeing several departments and offices and managing the County\u2019s fiscal financial functions.\nAs an Afro-Latina, Shelton is proud of her Black and Salvadoran ancestry. She understands the impacts of history on Black and Latino communities, and the importance of equity for all San Diego County residents.\n\u201cThe people that we serve, they are my lifelong friends and my family, and I understand explicitly how the decisions that we make here on a day-to-day basis impact the life, liberty and justice, of not just my friends and family, but all San Diegans,\u201d said Shelton.\nShelton holds an Undergraduate Degree in Business Administration from the University of Phoenix and an Executive Master\u2019s Degree in Public Administration with an emphasis in Public Sector Leadership from California State University at Northridge.\nIn her personal time, Shelton enjoys spending time with her husband and three daughters.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240604.12.05.54"}
