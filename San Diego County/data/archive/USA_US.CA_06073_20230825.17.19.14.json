Customers with questions can call Cal-Am Water at 1-888-237-1333 or visit www.amwater.com\u00a0for more information.\nTo date, no illnesses or outbreaks have been reported associated with the contamination that led to the boil water advisory.\n\u201cThe County has been working closely with the state, the water agency and other local agencies in response to this situation,\u201d said San Diego County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Nora Vargas. I want to make sure that I emphasize that our County Emergency Operations Center has been activated and is setting up coordination events with all the emergency managers in the affected cities as well.\nThose residents and business that are impacted should follow the Centers for Disease Control guidance for a boil water order, which includes actions to ensure contaminated water is not consumed.\u00a0 Residents are advised to use bottled water to drink, prepare food and brush teeth when possible. If bottled water is not available, they need to boil water for at least a full minute and let it cool before it is safe to use.\n\u201cThe thing you don\u2019t want to do is basically ingest it because the bacteria that have been detected can cause gastrointestinal or diarrheal type of illnesses, but you can use the water for other purposes,\u201d said Dr. Eric McDonald, interim HHSA director. \u201cI would emphasize specifically that people get in trouble when they forget about their icemaker and their ice machine, if they\u2019re brushing their teeth, or if they\u2019re bathing small children. The small amounts that small children can inadvertently ingest can cause, again those types of illnesses, as we\u2019ve discussed.\u201d\nCalifornia-American Water is investigating the source of the contamination and will work with the County to ensure residents are updated.\nEnvironmental Health and Quality inspectors are reaching out to make sure the 300 impacted food facilities and restaurants are aware that it\u2019s unsafe to prepare food, wash dishes and hands with E. coli contaminated water, and Public Health Services is notifying impacted healthcare facilities.\nIn addition, the Office of Emergency Services posted a survey for affected businesses to determine the financial impact of the advisory.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230825.17.19.14"}
