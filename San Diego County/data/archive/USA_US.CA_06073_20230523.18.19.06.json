Lost wages amount to nearly $13 million dollars.\nThe County\u2019s Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement (OLSE) will administer and accept applications for the fund. OLSE will also give wage theft victims information on how they may qualify for CalFresh, CalWORKS, the County Libraries\u2019 GED and Broadband Program, and many more services.\nOLSE continually educates businesses on compliance with labor standards laws through multiple Know-your-Rights campaigns and seminars, so businesses are aware and act in good faith.\nOLSE also acts as a regional resource for all San Diegans who have questions about workers\u2019 rights and labor law compliance. The office offers information about a wide range of topics including sick leave, overtime, wages and more.\nFor more information, visit the OLSE website, call the OLSE advice line at 619-985-1597\u00a0or email\u00a0OLSE@sdcounty.ca.gov.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230523.18.19.06"}
