Influenza-related deaths remain at seven for the 2021-2022 season.\n\u201cDuring average flu seasons, influenza activity would be winding down by this time, but we are seeing a late spike in cases this year,\u201d said Ankita Kadakia, Deputy Public Health Officer. \u201cEven though it is late in the season, it is not too late to vaccinate if you have not done so.\u201d\nAlthough the flu vaccine is recommended for nearly everyone six months and older, it is especially recommended for people at higher risk of developing complications from the flu. They include:\n\nPeople with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control\nPregnant women\nPeople aged 65 years and older\nPeople who live with or care for others who are at higher risk\n\nThe latest\u00a0Influenza Watch Report\u00a0from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending May 28, 2022:\n\nEmergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 4% of all visits (compared with 4% the previous week).\nLab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 205 (compared to 196 the previous week).\nTotal lab-confirmed cases to date: 3,479 (compared to 830 at the same time last season and a 11,713 prior 5-year average during the same week).\nInfluenza-related deaths reported to date: seven (compared to two last season).\n\nTips to Prevent the Flu\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The COVID-19 vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.\nThe influenza vaccine is available at doctors\u2019 offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County\u2019s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County\u2019s\u00a0Flu Vaccine Locations\u00a0page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.\nIn addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:\n\nWash hands thoroughly and often;\nUse hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;\nStay away from sick people;\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;\nClean commonly touched surfaces; and\nIf you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.\n\nDuring the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220601.11.19.33"}
