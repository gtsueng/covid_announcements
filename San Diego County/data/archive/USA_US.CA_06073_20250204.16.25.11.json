N. Harrington noticed Eagle with an open, necrotic wound on her right hind leg. Eagle\u2019s owner was uncooperative in getting Eagle veterinary care or surrendering her, resulting in a court-ordered seizure to allow Animal Services to get Eagle immediate veterinary attention. Unfortunately, the medical team was unable to save her leg, and a costly surgery was her only chance.\nCounty Animal Services dipped into its Spirit Fund to pay for Eagle\u2019s surgery.\n\u201cShe\u2019s almost all healed and she\u2019s doing great,\u201d said Harrington. Eagle is not yet available for adoption, but Harrington is hopeful she will be soon.\nSince her surgery, Eagle\u2019s demeanor has completely changed, the lieutenant said. She is more open to interactions with people.\nWithout emergency veterinary care funds, animals like Eagle would likely have to be euthanized to alleviate suffering.\nCounty Animal Services established the Spirit Medical Fund in July 2008, after people around the County donated to help a 10-week-old puppy who had been rescued with severe injuries caused by a beating. Shelter staff named the puppy Spirit because, despite her extensive injuries, her spirit was not broken, and she was still a loving dog.\u00a0 Spirit was adopted by a caring family, but the love for her and other animals continues.\nSo many donations had come in for Spirit that the remaining money was used to help other animals in need, like a puppy found in a dumpster bin with his ears cut off and a dog that was relinquished because the owner couldn\u2019t afford medical care for a broken limb.\nYou can help animals like Eagle, through adoption,\u00a0fostering or donating to the\u00a0Spirit Medical Fund. All donations are tax deductible and can be\u00a0made online, scroll down to the Donations section,\u00a0or in person or mail with a check made payable to County Animal Services\u201d and \u201cDonation for Spirit Fund\u201d in the memo field of the check.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250204.16.25.11"}
