We know that struggle continues for many. We want this money to help people overcome those hardships.\u201d\nThe Recovery Action Fund for Tomorrow (RAFT) program was developed by Jewish Family Service and funded by the County with federal American Rescue Plan Act funds. To be eligible, people and families must earn less than 200% of the federal poverty level, which ranges from $29,160 a year for a single person to $60,000 for a family of four.\nFamilies and people can apply for the funds from May 8 through midnight, Sunday, May 21. Officials said 2,250 families or people will be selected randomly from the pool of applicants by Jewish Family Service to receive the money.\nThose who receive the $4,000 allocations can use them as they see fit on their most urgent needs and they do not have to pay the money back. The money can be electronically transferred directly into people\u2019s bank accounts, Venmo/PayPal accounts or gig work platforms.\n\u201cAt Jewish Family Service we are already seeing immense benefits from a similar program we launched last year,\u201d said Khea Pollard, director of Economic Mobility And Opportunity for Jewish Family Service. \u201cWe know that direct cash assistance programs are a very effective and efficient way to reduce poverty and increase equity in our communities and we look forward to working on RAFT with the County.\u201d\nApplicants will need to submit documents to show they are eligible, including their identification and proof of household income levels. Documents can include driver\u2019s licenses, passports, green cards or state ID\u2019s, 2020 or 2021 tax returns, social security documents or enrollment paperwork for assistance programs like CalFresh or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). People can get full information about the program, find out if they are eligible and apply on the Jewish Family Service web page starting Monday.\nNick Macchione, director of the County\u2019s Health and Human Services Agency, said the County hopes the RAFT funding can be a lifeline.\n\u201cThis one-time cash payment can be life changing for those recovering from the pandemic,\u201d Macchione said. \u201cThis can help families, seniors, and our most vulnerable neighbors secure permanent housing, invest in reliable transportation, or get over an economic hurdle.\u201d\nFor more information about the program, go to the Jewish Family Service website\u00a0starting Monday, May 8.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230505.12.35.00"}
