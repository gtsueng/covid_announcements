About half of the apartments are reserved for people in need of mental health services through the County\u2019s No Place Like Home program.\nA National CORE development, Nestor Senior Village was built on surplus land owned by the Nestor United Methodist Church, one of the oldest churches in San Diego with a long history of providing support for unhoused San Diegans. Residents share onsite amenities with the church including outdoor recreation space and a food pantry. Nestor Senior Village also has a courtyard with outdoor seating, a community room, a laundry room, private offices for case management and 34 parking spots.\nMore information about the project is available here.\n\u201cSan Diego\u2019s high cost of housing has resulted in a growing number of seniors experiencing homelessness,\u201d said David Estrella, director of the County\u2019s Housing and Community Development Services department. \u201cInvestments and partnerships like this are a critical part of the County\u2019s commitment to provide the housing, and stability it can bring, to our most vulnerable older adults.\u201d\nNestor Senior Village is within walking distance to grocery stores and pharmacies, a park, and the Nestor Community Health Center. It is also directly adjacent to two bus stops and the trolley.\nSince 2017, the County has invested more than $305 million in affordable housing, including using County excess property and its Innovative Housing Trust Fund, and over 2,100 units have opened. There are an additional 3,286 units on the way.\nWhen all the developments in the pipeline are complete, the total number of affordable units supported by the County will reach over 9,500. This is expected to provide homes to nearly 21,000 people.\nThe development plans align with the County\u2019s\u202fHousing Blueprint,\u202fthe County\u2019s guide and ongoing response to the regional housing crisis.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240404.16.52.30"}
