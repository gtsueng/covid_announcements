With Thanksgiving two weeks away, there is no better time than now to get your COVID-19 bivalent booster and flu shot.\nIt takes about two weeks after vaccination until the body develops sufficient immunity against both viruses, so this is the ideal time to get the two vaccines before getting together with family during the upcoming holidays.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let flu, COVID-19 or respiratory syncytial virus ruin your family reunions this holiday season,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cProtect yourself and your family, stay up to date on flu and COVID-19 vaccines and consider masking in crowded indoor spaces until virus activity slows.\u201d\nCOVID-19 and flu vaccines are widely available across the region and can be administered during the same visit. It\u2019s important to note that the flu vaccine does not protect people against COVID and the COVID vaccine or booster does not protect against the flu. Therefore, it is recommended that eligible San Diegans get vaccinated for both viruses.\nThere is no vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) but established disease prevention measures can protect people from getting ill with any of the three respiratory viruses that are currently circulating in the community.\nThese measures include:\n\nConsider a well-fitting, good-quality mask, especially indoors or in crowded spaces.\nWash hands thoroughly and often;\nUse hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;\nStay away from sick people;\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;\nClean commonly touched surfaces; and\nIf you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.\n\nLocal Vaccination Efforts\nCOVID-19 booster vaccination rates in San Diego County are right in line with rates in other parts of the state. So far, 328,172 San Diegans have received their bivalent booster.\nThat\u2019s about 13% of eligible County residents, about the same as rates in other parts of the state\nCOVID-19 Vaccination Progress:\n\nMore than 2.68 million or 80.3% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.\nBoosters administered: 1,490,046 or 59.8% of 2,490,511 eligible San Diegans.\nMore vaccination information can be found at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.\n\nCOVID-19 Deaths:\n\n12 additional deaths were reported since the last report on Nov. 3, 2022. The region\u2019s total is 5,543.\nOf the 12 additional deaths, five were women and seven were men. They died between Sept. 1, 2021 and Oct. 1, 2022. None of the newly reported deaths occurred in the last two weeks.\nSix of the people who died were 80 years or older, two were in their 70s, two were in their 60s and two were in their 50s.\nEight received at least the primary series of the vaccine and four had not.\nTen had underlying medical conditions and two did not have any underlying medical conditions.\n\nCOVID-19 Cases, Case Rates and Testing:\n\n2,016 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Nov. 1 to Nov. 7, 2022). The region\u2019s total is now 933,270.\nThe 2,016 cases reported in the past week were higher compared to the 1,702 infections identified the previous week (Oct. 25 to Oct. 31, 2022).\n5,957 tests were reported to the County on Nov. 5, and the percentage of new positive cases was 4.1% (Data through Nov. 5).\nThe 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Nov. 5, is 3.8%.\n\nInfluenza Activity\nThe County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the\u00a0Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report\u00a0weekly. The report is published each Thursday and tracks key respiratory illness indicators, including flu cases and deaths.\nFor the week ending Nov. 5, 2022, the report shows the following:\n\nNo additional flu deaths, the season\u2019s total remains at 2\nEmergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 9% of all visits (compared with 7% the previous week)\nLab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 1,732 (compared to 1,201 the previous week)\nTotal lab-confirmed cases to date: 5,471 (compared to 291 at the same time last season and a 259 prior 5-year average during the same week)\n\nMore Information:\nData updates to the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0will be published Thursdays around 5 p.m., with the exception of holidays. More information about the flu is available on the County\u2019s influenza website.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20221110.17.29.00"}
