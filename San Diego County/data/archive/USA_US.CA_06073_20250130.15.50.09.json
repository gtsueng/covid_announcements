Dozens of teams spread out in all parts of the County before people are up and moving.\nMayra Fernandez Garcia engages with a man waking up on the sidewalk who agrees to be surveyed for the Point in Time Count.\nHessler and Fernandez Garcia with the County Office of Homeless Solutions and Mercedes Irazoqui, a Human Services Specialist with County Self-Sufficiency Services make up a Downtown San Diego team today. Equipped with a printed map, the survey on a phone app form, and gift cards, the team first walks up to a man in a sleeping bag laid on a rug outside an office building.\n\u201cSome of the people we talked to today have been homeless for more than five, eight, 10 years,\u201d said Hessler. \u201cWe hear a lot of their stories for what caused their homelessness. Sometimes it can be that they lost a loved one, they lost their home or they lost their job. Just simple things that can happen to anybody, it is not necessarily that they have substance abuse or mental health issues.\u201d\nBy sunrise, after engaging with about 30 people, the team has made their way to the Embarcadero area. People are packing up their sleeping mats and blankets. One man is interviewed as he gets ready to mount his bicycle and head to his next location.\nPeople who were not interested in taking the survey are still counted in the app and their location is noted.\nThe County has multiple programs in place to help connect people to the services they need, including finding a stable place to live. People can find more information online from the Office of Homeless Solutions or by calling 2-1-1.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250130.15.50.09"}
