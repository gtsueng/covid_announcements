Wooten, officials from the County\u2019s public health lab, its Department of Environmental Health and Quality, and others gathered Wednesday morning near the Imperial Beach Pier for the announcement.\nVargas said the County plans to expand its use Thursday of the DNA-based droplet-digital polymerase chain reaction testing technology \u2014 ddPCR \u2014 to more than 70 miles of shoreline the County regularly samples and tests to protect the public.\nThe new system will let the County sample beach water in the morning, get results and warn the public by the afternoon instead of the next day.\nOfficials said the DNA-based system is also more sensitive to bacteria levels than the older method, which required growing bacterial cultures from water samples in petri dishes.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to announce with today\u2019s sampling, San Diego becomes the first coastal county in the nation to implement the ddPCR method for beach water sampling,\u201d Vargas said Wednesday to applause.\n\u201cFaster results,\u201d she said, \u201care going to allow the County to issue or lift beach advisories on the same day samples were collected. And it reduces the time the public could unknowingly be at risk and \u2026 when the water is contaminated.\u201d\nThe County\u2019s Public Health laboratory and the state conducted a side-by-side study of how the DNA testing compared to the petri-dish system in 2019.\nThe California Department of Public Health gave the new system its final laboratory approval in February, clearing the way for the County to expand its use of the process.\nFor more information about the County\u2019s beach water quality testing program and check local conditions, visit the County\u2019s \u201cCheck In Before You Get In\u201d website at sdbeachinfo.com.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220504.15.48.15"}
