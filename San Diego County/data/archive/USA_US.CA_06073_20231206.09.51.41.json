Next year\u2019s event is planned for Dec. 7.\nThe youth participants in this year\u2019s 30th annual \u201cShop with a Cop\u201d event enjoyed breakfast and a private Dolphin Show at SeaWorld followed by shopping at Target. Shop with a Cop is an annual event hosted by STAR/PAL and a committee of local law enforcement agencies, led this year by the National City Police Department, SeaWorld, and Target. Law enforcement officers from over 25 different local, state, and federal agencies participated in the event by partnering with a school on their beat and spending the day getting to better know the youth and families they serve in the neighborhoods they patrol.\n\nThe children were selected from local elementary schools by counselors and teachers as well as officer referrals.\nFor STAR/PAL, the aim of the day was not only to provide children with a happier holiday season, but also build meaningful relationships between law enforcement and youth through nonenforcement interactions that cultivate communal trust.\nThe San Diego District Attorney\u2019s Office\nSan Diego County Probation Department\nSan Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231206.09.51.41"}
