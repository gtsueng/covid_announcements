Meeting our community\u2019s basic needs supports the health and overall wellness of our community members,\u201d Sheriff\u2019s Commander Will Brown said.\nThe agreement expands a previous pilot program from last year between the County and Lucky Duck Foundation in which the Sheriff\u2019s Department provided food, food preparation, and delivery service to the foundation\u2019s two distribution locations in the county three times a week.\nDrew Moser, Executive Director of the Lucky Duck Foundation, said the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s involvement has been key to the program\u2019s success and expansion from feeding 400 people per day to more than 1,000 people per day. Brown said Sheriff Bill Gore agreed to expand the service because he knew his department already has the infrastructure in place to produce and package meals on a large scale and his staff have a passion and commitment to serving people\n\u201cThe Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s commercial kitchen, which already generates more than 15,000 meals a day, is a great resource that enables these meals to be made, packed, and delivered,\u201d said Moser. \u201cAnd the cost of the meals, given the County\u2019s buying power, makes this program scalable so that philanthropy can cover the costs of all meals.\u201d\nMoser said after the meals are prepared by the Sheriff\u2019s Department and transported to Lucky Duck Foundation distribution sites in Miramar and Chula Vista. Volunteers at those sites sort and organize the meals for more than 30 outreach teams from 25 different social service agencies that blanket the county to deliver the meals to people living on the streets.\n\u201cThe objective is two-fold,\u201d said Moser. \u201cIt provides nourishment and equips outreach workers with an important tool for building trust and rapport to help the homeless end their homelessness by connecting them to available resources.\u201d\nMoser said the program also employs formerly homeless individuals, one of whom serves as a distribution site coordinator.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210323.16.13.37"}
