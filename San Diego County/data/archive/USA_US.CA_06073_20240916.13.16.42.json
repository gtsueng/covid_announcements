The new park is also adding more \u2018green to the scene\u2019 with an estimated 200 trees and 6,000 shrubs for shade. They will be drought-tolerant to align with County sustainability goals.\nOn-site maintenance and security have been built into the design plan, thanks to the addition of a volunteer pad where a live-on volunteer host will reside.\u00a0 These volunteers stay overnight to keep watch over the park, help with cleanup and maintenance projects and even facilitate park programs in exchange for their stay.\nResidents had a chance to get involved in designing the park from the beginning. County Parks held public meetings, issued surveys, worked with focus groups and spoke with community planning groups to hear what residents wanted.\nA grand opening is expected in fall 2025.\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240916.13.16.42"}
