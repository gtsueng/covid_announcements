Just order an Ivy rain barrel online at the\u00a0Solana Center\u2019s website\u00a0and choose to pick it up at one of two COVID-protected events: Saturday, Oct. 24 in El Cajon or Saturday, Nov. 7 in Valley Center.\nThe rain barrels will not be shipped. Order your rain barrel by Oct. 18 to pick it up from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 24 at the Water Conservation Garden at 12122 Cuyamaca College Drive in El Cajon.\nOrder by Oct. 31 to pick your barrel up from 9 a.m. to noon Saturday, Nov. 7 at Bates Nut Farm at 15954 Woods Valley Road in Valley Center.\nTo protect everyone, customers must wear masks and remain in their cars. Workers at the events will also wear masks and load rain barrels into people\u2019s trunks or back seats. There will be also be a staging area separated from the pickup spot for customers who need to adjust tie-downs or take other measures to secure rain barrels. A fuller explanation of the pickup process is located on the Solana Center\u2019s webpage. \nIf you can\u2019t make either pickup event, you can also pick up your barrel from noon to 5 p.m. on Thursdays and from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturdays at the Solana Center\u2019s Encinitas offices at 137 N. El Camino Real.\nCounty residents can apply for a $35 rebate that can shrink their rain barrel\u2019s cost from $90 to $55 if they get their water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California \u2014 either through the San Diego County Water Authority or its participating member agencies in San Diego County.\nIn addition, the County of San Diego is giving out its own $30 discount to residents who live in unincorporated areas \u2014 on the first 200 rain barrels ordered. Get that and your final cost shrinks to just $25!\nHaving a rain barrel can let you \u201charvest\u201d rain right off your roof and use it to keep your gardens or lawns green the old-fashioned way. That can cut your water costs and even help protect our local beaches by preventing excess rain from washing pollution off our roofs and yards, and down our streets to the ocean.\nThe Ivy Rain Barrels have a locking, child-proof lid, are made of 100% recycled material, have overflow ports, protective screening to keep mosquitoes out, a \u00be-inch ball valve to connect to your garden hose or to another barrel, and they don\u2019t need pumps because they use gravity to dispense their collected rainwater.\nGetting your discounted rain barrel is as easy as one, two, three.\nOne, order your barrel. Two, apply for your rebate(s). Three, go pick up your barrel.\nOrder and buy your barrel\nGo to the\u00a0County/Solana Center\u2019s rain barrels website. Scroll halfway down the page and click on one of the two options to start your purchase:\n\n\u201cCheck address & Start Purchase\u201d (to buy a $60 barrel if you live in the Unincorporated County)\n\u201cStart Purchase\u201d (to buy a $90 barrel if you\u2019re a resident living in an incorporated city.)\n\nFrom there you\u2019ll be asked to choose one of the three pickup locations. Do that and you can order and pay for your rain barrel with a credit card.\nYou may buy as many rain barrels as you\u2019d like, but the Metropolitan rebate and County discount are limited to two per household.\nFinally, remember that your rain barrel will not be delivered. You can pick it up at any of the three pickup locations; remember to print out and bring your receipt.\nApply for your rebate(s)\n$35 rebates from the Metropolitan Water District are available within 90 days of ordering/buying your rain barrel, so as soon as you order your rain barrel go to Metropolitan\u2019s SoCalWaterSmart\u00a0rain barrel rebates webpage. Rebates are available on a first-come, first-served basis. You can check out the Metropolitan Water District rebates\u2019\u00a0frequently asked questions\u00a0for help.\nPick up your rain barrel!\nWhen you buy your barrel(s), Rainwater Solutions will email you a confirmation of your purchase. Remember to bring your confirmation email with you when you go to your chosen location to pick up your barrel. And remember to leave room in your car!
