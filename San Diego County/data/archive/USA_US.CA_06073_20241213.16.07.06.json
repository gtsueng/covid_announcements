When the Navy\u2019s Second Class Petty Officer Association reached out to the County\u2019s Department of Animal Services asking to help in a way that would be meaningful, staff told them about the new Dog\u2019s Day Out program. The program is a service to the community that allows people to foster an animal for a day or just a few hours for an outing. This service gives dogs a break from the shelter environment and lets them really stretch their legs. At the same time, it also helps advertise the foster program and adoption in the community.
