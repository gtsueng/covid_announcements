The three-hour interactive training was put on by Game Changers, a community organization that uses a national \u201cpre-de-escalation\u201d training model rooted in behavioral psychology. \u00a0The program creates opportunities for empathy and understanding between officers and the youth currently involved in the justice system.\nGame Changers partnered with the Point Loma Nazarene University\u2019s criminal justice program and the event was hosted Wednesday at San Diego County\u2019s Youth Transition Campus for the first time.\nThe discussion took place between five San Diego probation officers, a San Diego Sheriff\u2019s captain, and two La Mesa police officers with 10 detained juvenile girls and five Point Loma Nazarene University criminal justice majors.\nCalifornia law enforcement officers who participate can earn continuing education units from the state for their involvement in the discussions.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250321.17.50.15"}
