Interviewers will pick seven households from each block to be surveyed. \nCounty health officials encourage community members to share their experiences if their household is randomly selected to do the survey.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\u201cIt is important to hear directly from people who live near the Tijuana River Valley,\u201d said Dr. Ankita Kadakia, County interim public health officer. \u201cIf you get a knock on your door in the next couple of days from a CASPER interview team, please speak with interviewers and provide your honest answers.\u201d\u00a0\nThe responses from the assessment on how living in close proximity to pollution in the Tijuana River Valley has affected people\u2019s lives will be analyzed and used by the County to make future decisions. The results can help determine what additional actions to take, find gaps in information, what resources are needed, and understand new or changing needs within the community.\u202f\u00a0\n \u201cThe CDC has supported our partners in using the CASPER method for decades to quickly gather household-based information about community health concerns,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Bernstein, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). \u201cThese interviews will provide firsthand insights into how the sewage contamination is impacting the daily lives of residents, helping to inform solutions.\u201d\u00a0\nCounty public health has spent the last few weeks informing community members about the upcoming health assessment through door-hangers and social media videos including on NextDoor in specific communities.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe work to bring the CDC to San Diego started back in May 2024 when the County contacted the California Department of Public Health requesting support in addressing the Tijuana River Valley pollution situation. Additionally, a formal request to the CDC\u2019s National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) requesting an Epi-Aid investigation into the Tijuana River Valley was submitted on June 25, 2024.\u202f The Epi-Aid was verbally approved on July 31, 2024.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nThis is the first CASPER to take place in the County of San Diego. It has provided valuable insight in other communities where it was conducted.\u202f\u00a0\nAbout the CASPER Interviews\nCounty public health and CDC teams will conduct household interviews during the following dates and times:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThursday, Oct. 17, 2024,\u202ffrom\u202f2 p.m. to 7 p.m.\u00a0\n\n\nFriday, Oct. 18, 2024,\u202ffrom\u202f2 p.m. to 7 p.m.\u00a0\n\n\nSaturday, Oct. 19, 2024,\u202ffrom\u202f10 a.m. to 7 p.m.\u202f \u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\nInterview teams, who will be bilingual in English and Spanish, will be wearing identifying badges and white reflective vests. Interviews will take about 15 minutes to complete and are anonymous. Participating households will not be asked identifying information including about immigration status.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo learn more about\u202fhealth concerns and impacts from sewage and pollution in the Tijuana River Valley\u202fand the CASPER survey, visit\u202fsandiegocounty.gov/southregionhealth.\u202f\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241017.07.04.15"}
