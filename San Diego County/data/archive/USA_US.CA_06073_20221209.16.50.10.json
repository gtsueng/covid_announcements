Those positive with flu can contact their medical provider to discuss next steps, including treatment.\u201d\u00a0\nThe seven locations offering the no-cost testing appointments are open various hours, with at least one open every day of the week. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nAssessor Recorder County Clerk Building, 200 S Magnolia Ave. El Cajon\u00a0\nFormer Boys and Girls Club, 1301 Oleander Ave, Chula Vista\u00a0\nFormer USD Electronics Recycling Center, 5330 Linda Vista Rd.
