The academies are a structured training program where in-custody youth learn skills for fire fuel and vegetation management.\n\u201cI came from humble beginnings,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI always wanted to be a firefighter. I always wanted to help my community.\u201d\nLogan told the group he was a hard worker, but he came to realize that what he lacked was education. To address that, he earned his associate\u2019s degree. While in college, Logan says, he was surrounded with other like-minded people who wanted to improve themselves. When he earned his first degree, he liked how that felt. So, he decided to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. Not long after attaining that goal, Logan applied to get his master\u2019s degree with a goal of a 4.0 grade point average (GPA). This decision would change his life.\nLater in Logan\u2019s firefighting career, when the fire chief job opening was posted, the description said that the ideal candidate would have a master\u2019s degree. Even though others of higher ranks applied for the chief position, Logan got the position because of his experience and education.\nSupervising Probation Officer Eduardo Calderon said all the students in the Fuel Crew training program are enrolled in online or in-person college courses.\nOne youth will be getting his associate\u2019s degree in communications from a local community college in May with a 3.9 GPA.\u00a0 He said he found it inspiring to hear that Chief Logan had taken the same steps in education that he was now focused on.\nAlthough the young man said the Fire Fuel program is great, he signed up for the academy \u201cjust to build character and take what I\u2019m learning in this program and apply it to another avenue.\u201d\nAnd he has done that. The youth was accepted at five different universities. He\u2019s already decided to attend one outside of the county that has a support program for formerly incarcerated students.\nOther students are more serious about fire service. One youth wants to pursue it as a career. In listening to Logan, what really resonated with him was the part about how the people you spend time with influence your life choices.\n\u201cBeing in here, I\u2019ve noticed that we all have the same focus and we\u2019re all here just to better our lives,\u201d a youth said. \u201cIt has inspired me to be more disciplined and focused in my other (outside) life.\u201d\nCalderon said no one is considered for the program unless they are a high school graduate and have met the minimum expectations of their case-plan. All the youth are cleared for community service, and they do other projects unrelated to fire service, like helping pack and distribute food in the community.\nSan Diego County Fire Capt. Chris Capossere, who teaches the program coursework, has seen significant transformations in the youth in the program. He said he sees participants develop better communication skills and that they are well-positioned to apply leadership skills in the jobs they are trying to accomplish.\nFrom the first academy, one youth was referred to the Ventura Training Center, an 18-month fully sponsored fire training program. Another is being sponsored through his training process at a local fire department, Calderon said. Two more were accepted at a California Department of Corrections firefighting program.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about educating ourselves, and educating others, which is what you did here. You are setting examples for others to come,\u201d Probation Chief Tamika Nelson told the group. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250228.13.34.24"}
