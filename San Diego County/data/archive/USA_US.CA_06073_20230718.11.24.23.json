All boxes are labeled \u201cOfficial Ballot Drop Box\u201d and constructed from high grade, heavy gauge stainless steel.\nEach ballot drop box is designed to prevent physical damage and unauthorized access to mail ballots. The boxes feature double-locking access doors, anti-pry door jambs, and other anti-theft construction measures. The Registrar\u2019s ballot retrieval team is responsible for collecting ballots inside the box.\nHow do I return my ballot to an official ballot drop box?\nMark your ballot, seal your completed ballot inside your return envelope, date and sign your name on the return envelope, and return it in the mail or to one of the Registrar\u2019s 29 official ballot drop boxes around the district. Remember, your signature is required for your vote to count.\nTwenty-two official ballot drop boxes are located outdoors and are open 24-hours a day up until 8 p.m. on Election Day, Aug 15. Seven are located indoors and access to those is available during the individual facility\u2019s hours of operation.\nWith that in mind, voters should check each location\u2019s hours of operation before heading out to return their ballot. Find the closest one to you by visiting the Registrar\u2019s online locator tool.\nOn Election Day, Aug 15, all of the Registrar\u2019s official ballot drop box locations will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\nEarly voting also began Monday at the Registrar of Voters office in Kearny Mesa. You can vote there between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. However, the Registrar encourages voters to take advantage of the convenience of voting by mail.\nIf you prefer to vote early in person and avoid long lines, seven vote centers will open Saturday, Aug. 5. The vote centers will be open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. until the final day of voting, Tuesday, Aug. 15, when 14 vote centers will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\nYou can find an official ballot drop box or vote center location near you inside your voter information pamphlet, or you can look it up online at sdvote.com.\nLearn more about voting in the District 4 special primary election at sdvote.com, or call (858) 565-5800 or toll free at (800) 696-0136.
