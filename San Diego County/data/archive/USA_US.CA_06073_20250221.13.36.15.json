Support to find housing, jobs, healthcare, food, access to CalFresh, clothing, documents, mental health support, and substance use disorder services. There were even free showers and haircuts.\nThe event was primarily to help people on probation or parole. But it was also open to the public, with support for anyone needing help.\nOne of those attending the event was a young man named Jason. He said he once attended similar events in the past to seek help, but that he was there Wednesday to offer help instead, as he now works for a mental health provider in Oceanside.\nJason said he remembered just how helpful events like resource fair had been to him. He said he was able to immediately get access to services such as ID vouchers, help with birth certificates, food stamps, general relief, and referrals for employment and education.\nEddie Head, division chief for the reentry and pretrial services with the County of San Diego Probation Department, said it took a full year to put Wednesday\u2019s event together. He said it was modeled on a successful resource fair the Probation Department hosted at the East County Courthouse in April 2024.\n\u201cOur department ensures client accountability,\u201d Head said, \u201cbut our mission also includes providing the highest quality of services. We aim to help our clients and connect them to appropriate resources. We achieve this by offering opportunities like this fair to link them to the services they need.\u201d\nSome of the groups, agencies and organizations that were at Wednesday\u2019s event included: the County\u2019s Live Well on Wheels bus, the San Diego Access and Crisis Line, the Vista Community Clinic, the Women\u2019s Resource Center, the Center for Community Solutions, One Safe Place, the San Diego Rescue Mission, Alcoholics Anonymous of San Diego, the Center for Employment Opportunities, Goodwill Industries, and Home Start.\nJohn, a probationer, came to the event and said he hoped to find a job.\nHe said events like the resource fair were not only important for the tangible help they provide, but also for the hope they give to the people who come to them.\n\u201cSeeing these (community) fairs are important,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, because sometimes you feel alone. You see the community that\u2019s really cheering for you, it\u2019s beneficial for all of us\u2014to heal.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250221.13.36.15"}
