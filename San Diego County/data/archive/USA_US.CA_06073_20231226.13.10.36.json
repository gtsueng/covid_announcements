One in four people who are experiencing homelessness in San Diego County is over 55 years old, and this population demographic is growing.\nAn 18-month pilot program approved by the Board of Supervisors has begun helping some low-income older adults, 55 and over, pay rent and improve their housing stability. The Shallow Rental Subsidy Program launched this past spring and more than 2,000 older adults applied. The program will provide $500 monthly in rental assistance to 220 senior households chosen by lottery. For Matthew Pallamary, the extra money has helped him transition from couch surfing to a home of his own.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231226.13.10.36"}
