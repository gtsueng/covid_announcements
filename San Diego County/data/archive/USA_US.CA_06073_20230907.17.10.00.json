The report is a compilation of the most recent data on suicide in San Diego County.\u00a0\u00a0\nSuicides are tracked by rates, which is the number of deaths per 100,000 population.\u00a0\nDespite the downward trend in suicides overall from 2012 to 2021, death rates increased 7 percent for youth and young adults between the ages of 10 to 24, and 3 percent for adults between the ages of 25 to 44.\u00a0\nIn 2021, older adults 65 years and above had the highest suicide rate (16.4 per 100,000).\u00a0\nWhite residents experienced the highest suicide rate in 2021 (16.5). For Hispanic residents, suicide rates\u00a0 from 2012 to 2021 increased by 26 percent, from 4.5 to 5.6.\u00a0\nSpeakers said the data trends highlight the need for continued and increased prevention efforts for populations who are especially vulnerable to suicide. Proactively seeking help and resources, talking openly and honestly, and staying connected as a community are crucial to reducing suicides in our region and ensuring everyone has the support they need.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo view the complete 2022 Report to the Community, visit\u202fwww.spcsandiego.org.\u00a0\nSuicide can be prevented.
