Any person who sells or provides an alcoholic beverage to a minor can receive up to a $1,000, six months in jail or both.\nParents play a key role in preventing underage drinking. Health and safety experts recommend the following tips for parents to discourage underage drinking and other risky behavior.\nStay Involved: Show your children you care by spending time with them and doing something fun and interactive together.\nCommunicate: Regardless of the season, it is always a good to talk to your children about the dangers of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs.\nSet Rules: Establish clear rules regarding your expectations on drinking and marijuana use, as well as on unsupervised time spent with friends.\nSupervise: This can be challenging especially for parents of high school students; however, be physically present when you can. When you can\u2019t, ask a neighbor, relative or friend to check on them.\nMonitor: Know what your children are doing and where they are always. Randomly call and text them.\nEngage: Help your children set some structure during summer by helping them find a summer job or engaging them in supervised activities, such as sports, camps and classes.\nTeam Up: Get to know the parents of your children\u2019s friends. Make sure they feel the same way you do about underage drinking and marijuana use.\nEducating residents about making healthy and safe choices is part of Live Well San Diego, the County\u2019s ongoing initiative to improve the health and well-being of residents.\nIf you have a tip about an underage drinking or marijuana use party, you can call the Crime Stoppers Anonymous Tip Line 24 hours per day at (888) 580-8477. You could be eligible for up to a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.\nParents who suspect their child might have a drinking or drug use problem are encouraged to call the County of San Diego Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 or 211.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240607.11.04.23"}
