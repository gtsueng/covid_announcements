Volunteers train on a regular basis to be able to assist fellow residents in basic disaster response and recovery efforts.\nMembers of several CERTs from across the county combined forces through a mutual aid plan to support residents over the past year helping to distribute food, provide administrative assistance at COVID-19 testing and vaccination sites, and supporting fire evacuation efforts.\nAccording to Teresa Greenhalgh, the county\u2019s CERT coordinator, while the local CERT mutual aid plan has been in place since 2012, it had not been utilized until the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cFollowing county guidelines in regard to underlying health conditions and those ages 65 and above, a large portion of each CERT programs\u2019 members could not work these events,\u201d said Greenhalgh. \u201cWithout implementing CERT mutual aid, many of the programs would not have been able to deploy their teams due to the few available members who could volunteer.\u201d\nGreenhalgh said COVID response was not the only mission of CERT volunteers last year, who also assisted in a more traditional role supporting the Red Cross at temporary evacuation points for the Valley Fire last September.\n\u201cCERT members are initially shelter trained to support the American Red Cross in San Diego but did have to complete a virtual training on supporting temporary evacuation points,\u201d said Greenhalgh. \u201cThis training was completed by local CERT members just days before the Valley Fire started.\u201d\nMembers of the CERT program said that while COVID presented some challenges in 2020, the cooperative spirit of the participants made it a worthwhile volunteer effort.\n\u201cWorking the COVID-19 Operation Collaboration vaccination site has been a great experience,\u201d said Kathy Rupert, a County Fire CERT member. \u201cIt is really rewarding as the people come thru and they are so excited to be getting vaccinated. It feels good to be helping the community.\u201d\nCounty residents interested in joining a CERT should contact their local CERT Manager, who can be found on the county\u2019s CERT information website. Additional information and program information is also available by contacting Greenhalgh via telephone at (619) 857-8050, or via email at Teresa.greenhalgh@sdcounty.ca.gov\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210412.13.32.14"}
