When Mpox cases started to go up in San Diego, County epidemiologists and UCSD researchers used disease modeling and found that people were mostly getting sick with Mpox through local transmission rather than when traveling outside of the region or state where cases were also rising. This led to the County prioritizing more vaccinations among local community members, especially those at greater risk for Mpox.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis work has also helped the County\u2019s efforts around hepatitis A by showing the effectiveness of a gift card incentive program at increasing hepatitis A vaccinations among people experiencing homelessness and preventing the spread of disease and its impact on local and County resources.\u00a0\nPlans for the newly approved funds include more work around tuberculosis control and dengue transmissions which are priority areas for the County. The work done in San Diego County will also help health jurisdictions and disease modeling throughout the United States.\u00a0\nThe grant period runs through September 2028.\u00a0\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240910.16.19.07"}
