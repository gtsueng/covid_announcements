This cultural tradition, which celebrates the memory of loved ones, including pets, invites the community to share a photo of departed pets and consider offering some of that love to a County shelter pet.\n\u201cD\u00eda de los Muertos offers us a special moment to remember the pets who have enriched our lives with unconditional love. By celebrating their memory, we are reminded of the joy they brought and the lasting impact they\u2019ve had on our hearts,\u201d said Animal Services Director Vaughn Maurice. \u201cWe also encourage the community to visit and consider adopting a new companion, so we can create more memories and love-filled homes for animals in need.\u201d\nFrom October 1st through November 2nd, Animal Services will feature special D\u00eda de los Muertos displays at its Carlsbad and Bonita shelters. The community is welcome to join in this heartfelt celebration by contributing photos of pets who have crossed the Rainbow Bridge. These photos will be placed on ofrendas, or Day of the Dead altars, that are beautifully decorated with flowers, candles and treats to commemorate the pets that have passed but remain in our hearts.\nHow to Participate:\n\nBring a printed photo of your beloved pet to the lobby at either our Carlsbad or Bonita shelter during the month of October.\nYour pet\u2019s photo will be displayed on the D\u00eda de los Muertos ofrendas, where we will honor their memory.\u00a0We will share a photo of the ofrenda on D\u00eda de los Muertos.\nWhile you\u2019re visiting, take time to meet our wonderful adoptable pets who are eager to find their forever homes.\n\nCounty Animal Services set up the displays to provide comfort and connection to those grieving.\nConsider opening your hearts and homes to the many pets waiting for adoption.\nAll animals adopted from County shelters will be spayed or neutered, have vaccinations, a microchip and a one-year license for dogs in the service area.\nPlease visit County Animal Services\u2019\u00a0Adoptions\u00a0page and browse the beautiful and lovable animals from cats to dogs to pigs, roosters and a chinchilla available now. Animal Services staff recommend that people pick out a second and third choice too, just in case your first choice is already chosen by another person.\nWalk-in hours are from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday at both the South Shelter, 5821 Sweetwater Road in Bonita, or the North Shelter, 2481 Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad.\nCounty Animal Services is committed to the safety and welfare of animals and the community. Through education, adoption, and compassionate care, it works to provide homes for adoptable animals while promoting responsible pet ownership.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241001.16.45.43"}
