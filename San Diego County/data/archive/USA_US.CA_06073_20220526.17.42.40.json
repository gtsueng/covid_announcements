Treatment can help prevent high-risk individuals from getting sick enough to need hospital services and even from dying from COVID.\nOral medications, in the form of pills, and monoclonal antibodies, in the form of an intravenous infusion, are available at multiple locations and community pharmacies across San Diego. Antiviral medications require a doctor\u2019s prescription and should be started within five days of developing symptoms of COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies should be given no more than seven days after the onset of symptoms.\nTo determine which treatment is best for you, talk to your doctor or health care provider, or call 2-1-1 to find a provider.\u00a0Monoclonal Antibody Regional Centers\u00a0(MARCs) offer treatment with the anti-viral pill Paxlovid and with monoclonal antibody Bebtelovimab, which are both effective against the Omicron variant. You can call (619) 685-2500, seven days a week, to schedule a no-cost appointment, regardless of health insurance or immigration status. A referral or prescription is not required.\nVaccination Progress:\n\nReceived at least one shot: More than 2.96 million or 94.1% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.\nFully vaccinated: Over 2.62 million or 83.4%.\nBoosters administered: 1,330,530 or 58.5% of 2,273,207 eligible San Diegans.\nMore vaccination information can be found at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.\n\nDeaths:\n\nSix additional deaths were reported since the last report on May 19.
