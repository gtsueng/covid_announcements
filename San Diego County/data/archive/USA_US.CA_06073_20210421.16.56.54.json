This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.\nOverall, close to 1.32 million County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That\u2019s 49% of those eligible.\nOf those vaccinated to date, nearly 847,000 County residents, or 31.5% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nThe goal is to fully vaccinate\u00a075% of San Diego County residents 16 and older or 2,017,011 people. To date, 65.3% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 42% are fully vaccinated.\nThose who received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine,\u00a0which is currently on hold\u00a0in the County due to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration, are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses shipped and the number of vaccinations administered represents approximately what is expected to be used in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s\u00a0vaccination dashboard. For vaccination opportunities, visit\u00a0www.vaccinationsuperstation.com.\n\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 6.1 cases per 100,000 residents (as of April 20).\nThe County remains in the Orange Tier or Tier 3 under the state\u2019s new guidance. The California Department of Public Health indicates that unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as low rate of vaccine uptake, a county will only move to a more restrictive tier if hospitalizations are increasing significantly among vulnerable individuals, especially among vaccinated individuals, and both testing positivity and adjusted case rates show a concerning increase in transmission. This is currently not the case in the region.\nCurrently, the testing positivity percentage is 2.4%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 3.0% and is also in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.\nCDPH assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, April 27.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nEight new community outbreaks were confirmed April 20: two in restaurant/bar settings, two in grocery/retail settings, one in a daycare/preschool/childcare setting, one in government setting, one in a business setting and one in a TK-12 grade school setting.\nIn the past seven days (April 14 through April 20), 21 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n16,947 tests were reported to the County on April 20, and the percentage of new positive cases was 2%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 1.7%. Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 12,872.\n\nCases, Hospitalizations and ICU Admissions:\n\n263 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County on April 20. The region\u2019s total is now 275,631.\n15,186 or 5.5% of all cases have required hospitalization.\n1,676 or 0.6% of all cases and 11% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nSeven new COVID-19 deaths were reported April 20. The region\u2019s total is 3,681.\nFour women and three men died between April 4 and April 19.\nOf the people who died, two were 80 years of age or older, one was in their 70s, two were in their 60s, one was in their 50s and one was in their 40s.\nAll had underlying medical conditions.\n\nMore Information:\nThe more detailed data summaries found on the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0are updated around 5 p.m. daily.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210421.16.56.54"}
