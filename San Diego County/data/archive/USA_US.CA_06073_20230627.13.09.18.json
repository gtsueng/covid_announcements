People can also call 2-1-1 to find a location, or, if they cannot get to a Cool Zone, ask for help with free transportation.\nThe Cool Zone program runs from June 1 through Oct. 31. It gives people more than 60 places, including County and city libraries and community centers, to go to if they need respite from extra-high temperatures.\nExtreme heat can be especially dangerous for older adults and children. The County Health and Human Services Agency 2022 Excessive Heat Report released Friday stated there were 15 Heat Alerts issued by the National Weather Service, compared to 16 the year before.\nEveryone is recommended to shelter in cool locations when the temperatures get too hot. Working or exercising outside on a hot day or staying in a hot space too long can cause heat-related illnesses. Those can range from cramps to exhaustion and heatstroke\u2014a condition when the body can no longer control its temperature.\nFor more information about the County\u2019s Cool Zone program, go to the Health and Human Services Agency\u2019s website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230627.13.09.18"}
