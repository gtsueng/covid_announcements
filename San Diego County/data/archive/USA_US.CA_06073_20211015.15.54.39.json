Three sets of new graduates received their diplomas Thursday evening \u2014 fall 2019 students who finished school after that year\u2019s graduation ceremony, 2020 grads whose ceremony was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and 2021\u2019s graduates.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just a memorable occasion for the graduates; it was also special for the Library High School Program, which celebrated its largest ceremony since the program began in 2016. Thirty-three students donned caps and gowns to receive their diplomas at Spreckel\u2019s Organ Pavilion in Balboa Park.\nThe County Library High School program gives students 18 years and older a way to earn high school diplomas through a nationally recognized program. It\u2019s online, and students are able to go at their own pace. Classes are free.\nRoughly 13% of adults in San Diego County don\u2019t have high school diplomas. Some had to quit school to go to work or they faced circumstances that prevented them from completing high school. Library High School gives them another chance, one that allows them to work around their regular schedule.\n\u201cWe are incredibly proud of our students, who placed their trust in San Diego County Library and dedicated their time and resources to obtaining a much-deserved high school diploma,\u201d said San Diego County Library Director Migell Acosta. \u201cThese students worked at their studies after work, or after the children went to bed. Library High School opens an important door into new careers and supports the County Library\u2019s vision of equitable access for all.\u201d\nAny resident of San Diego County can apply for the program and students are accepted year-round. They can transfer up to 14 credits from their former high school and complete the online courses in five to 18 months. Students may also work toward a career certificate in any of eight different fields.\nWould-be students can apply online. They must take a prerequisite course to see if online learning would work for them and then the Library conducts virtual interviews before accepting applicants. Once enrolled, the student is provided with an online academic coach to help guide the student to be successful.\nThe program doesn\u2019t award a general education diploma, known as a GED, but an actual high school diploma which allows for more opportunities to qualify for higher education and job opportunities. The County\u2019s Department of Child Support Services partners with the program to refer potential students, enabling participants to further their education and improve employment prospects. Ten of those students were among the graduates Thursday.\nThe County\u2019s Library High School is operated by Smart Horizons Career Online High School, an accredited, private national online school district. Since 2016, 99 people have graduated from the County\u2019s online high school.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211015.15.54.39"}
