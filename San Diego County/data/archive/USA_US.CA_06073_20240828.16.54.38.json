Green Streets support the County\u2019s commitment to watershed protection and sustainability by filtering stormwater. The goal is to reduce or remove trash and pollutants before they can enter bodies of water like creeks, rivers and the ocean.\nContracted work will include the installation of a trash capture device beneath the road and a biofiltration basin that improves the landscaping above it. The trash capture device will remove trash, sediment and debris. The biofiltration basin will remove bacteria and nutrients from stormwater that would enter the San Luis Rey River.\nIn 2022, the Department of Public Works (DPW) published the Green Streets Clean Water Plan. The plan\u2019s primary goal is to protect the environment and improve water quality.\nThrough the plan, the County chose South Mission Road (North Segment) out of 30 ranked projects as a Green Street. The decision was based on potential water quality, environmental and community benefits, as well as cost-effectiveness.\nThe County uses a variety of tools to prioritize stormwater improvement projects in underserved areas. When completed, the project will help improve the County\u2019s water quality by reducing bacteria, trash and other pollutants.\nThe project is in step with the County\u2019s sustainability goals of protecting and promoting natural resources. It also improves the natural environment for residents, visitors and future generations to enjoy.\nThe total project cost is estimated at $3 million. Construction is scheduled to begin in late 2024 and be completed in the summer of 2025.\nFor more information about the County\u2019s upcoming and previously completed green infrastructure projects, visit DPW\u2019s website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240828.16.54.38"}
