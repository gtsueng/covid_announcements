The U.S. Senate\u2019s unanimous approval and designation of a week in June as National Pollinator Week was a needed step to addressing the issue of declining pollinator populations. The week gives scientists and the public a special week to celebrate pollinators and spread the word about what we all can do to protect them.\nRoughly 75% of all flowering plant species need animal pollinators to reproduce.\nAWM supports local farmers and the County\u2019s $1.8 billion agriculture industry by protecting native plant habitat for pollinators including bees, butterflies, bats, moths and flies through programs that help prevent the introduction of invasive plants, pests and diseases.\nIn addition, AWM\u2019s Apiary Program helps ensure the health and safety of managed bee colonies by inspecting apiaries and providing outreach about the importance of pollinators.\nYou can help pollinators by sharing Pollinator Week on your social media, building native bee houses, planting pollinator habitat in your yard and many other ways. For more information about how you can help, please visit pollinator.org, UC Cooperative Extension and AWM\u2019s Apiary Program, or call AWM\u2019s Bee Hotline at 1-800-200-BEES (2337).\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220621.12.37.31"}
