I\u2019m proud of all we have accomplished in the past four years, spending more than $6 million dollars on upgrades to fire stations and facilities throughout North County.\u201d\nSupervisor Joel Anderson, District 2 says, \u201cThis is welcome news for many of my constituents in the back country. The ISO rating is the culmination of more than a decade of work to strengthen emergency resources.\u00a0 It is an added benefit if our efforts can help residents and businesses in places like Ramona, Campo, and Mt. Laguna get a break on their insurance rates.\u201d\nBoard Chair Nathan Fletcher recognized the tremendous amount of work that went into achieving the rating. \u201cSince the devastating 2003 Cedar Fire, our County has invested more than $600 million. Those investments have improved fire protection and emergency medical services, added staffing, fire stations, made communication enhancements, increased training and brush management. We\u2019ve also added more ground and air equipment.\u201d\nCounty Fire\u2019s service area covers more than 1,500 square miles of San Diego County.\u00a0 Property owners are encouraged to contact their insurance companies to find out how the classification may affect their policy.\nCounty Fire reorganized fire services in the unincorporated areas in 2008, bringing nearly 20 largely volunteer run departments under a unified command.\u00a0 Professional firefighters and emergency personnel now respond to fires, medical calls and disasters across the County with upgraded fire apparatus and Advanced Life Support Paramedic engines.\nVerisk works across the country with insurance companies, communities, fire departments, insurance regulators, and others to assess risk.\u00a0 The research measures municipal fire suppression efforts, emergency communications capabilities, firefighting training levels, apparatus and equipment, and staffing, as well as community water supply.\nCounty Fire\u2019s response ensured the ISO considered the water systems and service levels in the communities of Campo, Lake Morena, Jacumba, Yuima and Julian, allowing over 3,800 properties to improve to a level 3 classification.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220930.10.19.07"}
