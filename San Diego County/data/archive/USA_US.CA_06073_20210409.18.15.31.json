That\u2019s 41.7% of those eligible.\nThose receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s vaccination dashboard.
