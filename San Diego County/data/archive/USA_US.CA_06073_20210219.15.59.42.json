As the delayed doses arrive, we will administer them to everyone who has an appointment and release new time slots.\u201d\nA COVID-19 vaccination is administered at the Grossmont Center Vaccination Super Station.\nNotification of Changed Appointments\nCurrently, all County COVID-19 vaccination points of dispensing, or PODs, and the North County Super Station in San Marcos are only offering appointments for second doses.\nAppointments for first doses at these sites are being rescheduled into next week. You should be notified of your new appointment date and time by the MyTurn appointment system or via email.\nIn addition, the vaccination super station at Petco Park is pausing all appointments through Saturday. The site could remain closed Sunday and Monday, depending on when more vaccine doses arrive.\nIf your appointment got cancelled, you should be notified via your UC San Diego Health MyChart account. You should also check your email.\nThe Sharp HealthCare vaccination super station sites at Chula Vista Center and Grossmont Center are still offering first and second dose appointments with Pfizer vaccine.\nShould appointments need to be changed at the Sharp Sites, you will be notified by PrepMod, their appointment system or via email. If you have questions about vaccination at these two sites you can email sharpcovidvaccineclinic@sharp.com.\nIf you have received your first dose, you should not be concerned about the minor delays in second dose appointments. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised that people can wait up to 42 days between doses and still achieve maximum immunity.\nMore information about the COVID-19 vaccine is available at www.vaccinationsuperstationsd.com.\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 22.2 cases per 100,000 residents and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 6.4%, placing the County in Tier 2 or the Red Tier. While the testing positivity rate for the County qualifies it for the Red Tier, the state uses the most restrictive metric \u2013 in this case the adjusted case rate \u2013 and assigns counties to that tier. Therefore, the County remains in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 9.7% and it\u2019s in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.
