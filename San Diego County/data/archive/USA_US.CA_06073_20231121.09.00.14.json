For many of us it means food, food and more food!\nAnd it\u2019s also a time, as our feasts run from Thanksgiving through New Year\u2019s, that it becomes pretty easy to waste food. Like when it\u2019s served up but we\u2019re too full to have another bite, or when it goes bad before we eat the leftovers.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe, but every year in the U.S. up to 40% of the total food supply goes to waste, according to the\u00a0United States Department of Agriculture\u00a0and\u00a0County of San Diego.\nThat\u2019s not only a waste of good food, it\u2019s also really hard on your wallet. The\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0(EPA) estimates the average family of four spends $1,500 a year on food that they end up not eating. It also wastes the land, water, energy and things used to produce, transport, prepare and store food.\nAnd get this, food waste can even make climate change worse.\nThat\u2019s because when you toss organic matter\u2015like food waste\u2015into landfills to decompose, it creates methane, a greenhouse gas pollutant. The\u00a0EPA said in 2022 that methane traps about 80 times the heat that carbon dioxide does\u00a0and is responsible for roughly one-third of the warming from greenhouse gases occurring today.\nSo with all of that in mind, here are some simple steps you can take to stop wasting food, save money and even fight climate change.\nReduce Wasted Food \u2014 Shop and Plan Wisely\nThe easiest way to reduce wasting food, during the holidays or just day to day, is to not cook too much, right? To help, plan ahead, shop smart and serve just enough food to make everyone happy. Of course, that sounds easy. But it can be hard to do. How do you know how much food is enough?\u00a0SaveTheFood.com\u00a0has a \u201cGuest-imator\u201d that can help you calculate how much food you need to prepare, based on how many people you\u2019re serving and how much they typically eat, even for Thanksgiving. And yes, it can even calculate having leftovers if you want them.\nFreeze or Find Ways to Reuse Leftovers\nOf course, even the best planners can end up with leftovers sometimes, especially at a big event like Thanksgiving. But you don\u2019t have to let them go to waste. If you\u2019re having guests, provide to-go containers, or invite your guests to bring their own, so they can take leftovers home with them. Rethink your leftovers and use them as ingredients for new meals. Leftover meat and vegetables can make a great soup or casserole. Or turn mashed potatoes into potato pancakes. And of course, you can freeze leftovers to use in future meals.\nCompost What\u2019s Left!\nAnd don\u2019t forget to compost leftovers. If you don\u2019t have your own compost pile or bin, you can place any remaining food scraps and organic waste into your curbside green bin!\u00a0(Note: If you do have your own compost bin at home, you probably want to avoid composting meats and bones; they can attract unwanted pests.)\nRecycling and Cutting Down on Wasting Food Can Keep Your Pipes Clean\nBelieve it or not, recycling and cutting back on wasting food can even protect your house. That\u2019s because cooking oils and grease can gunk up your plumbing and even cause sewage overflows if you discard them down your sink\u2019s drain. Making sure you\u2019re not over-preparing food can cut down on the amount of cooking oils you\u2019re using. And keeping used oils out of your plumbing by collecting them and recycling them can keep your pipes clean and your house protected. Contrary to popular belief, mixing used oils with soap, or pouring hot water down the drain after discarding oils in the sink, doesn\u2019t prevent fat clogs that can back up your pipes.\nThere are free drop-off locations for used cooking oils all around the county. Just collect your used cooking oils in a secure container with a lid and label it \u201cused cooking oil.\u201d Don\u2019t mix chemicals or other liquids in with them. To find the nearest drop-off location, visit the County\u2019s Recycling and Household Hazardous Waste database,\u00a0WasteFreeSD.org, or call 1-877-R-1-EARTH (1-877-713-2784).\nTo learn more about reducing wasting food, visit the County\u2019s\u00a0Solid Waste Planning and Recycling website. And have a great Holiday season!\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231121.09.00.14"}
