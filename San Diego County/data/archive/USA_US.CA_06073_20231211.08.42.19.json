Local food producers, workers, and businesses owned and/or operated by people in underserved communities are prioritized.\u00a0\nOver the past year, the County served about eight million meals to vulnerable populations. These groups include\u202folder adults, foster youth, individuals living with HIV/AIDS and\u202fyouth and adults residing in public hospitals and detention facilities.\u00a0\nPrioritizing locally sourced food is consistent with the region\u2019s Food Vision 2030, a 10-year strategic plan created in 2021 to reimagine the food system in the San Diego region.\u00a0\nAmong the objectives of Food Vision 2030 is to scale local, sustainable and equitable food value chains by leveraging the purchasing power of institutions.\u202f\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231211.08.42.19"}
