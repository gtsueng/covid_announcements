This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.\nOf those vaccinated to date, more than 368,000 County residents, or 13.7% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nOverall, more than 665,000 County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That\u2019s 24.7% of those eligible.\nThose receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s vaccination dashboard. For details on groups currently eligible and vaccination opportunities, visit www.vaccinationsuperstation.com.\n\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 8.8 cases per 100,000 residents (as of March 9) and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 3.3%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier. While the testing positivity rate for the County qualifies it for Tier 3, the state uses the most restrictive metric \u2013 in this case the adjusted case rate \u2013 and assigns counties to that tier. Therefore, the County remains in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 4.5% and is in the Orange Tier or Tier 3. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance to a less restrictive tier.\nThe California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, March. 16.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nThree new community outbreaks were confirmed March 9, two in business settings and one in a government setting.\nIn the past seven days (March 3 through March 9), 16 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n13,386 tests were reported to the County on March 9, and the percentage of new positive cases was 3%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 3.1%. Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 13,200.\n\nCases, Hospitalizations and ICU Admissions:\n\n349 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County on March 9. The region\u2019s total is now 264,097.\n13,282 or 5% of all cases have required hospitalization.\n1,614 or 0.6% of all cases and 12.2% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nEight new COVID-19 deaths were reported March 9. The region\u2019s total is 3,413.\nFive women and three men died between Feb. 25 and March 9.\nOf the eight deaths reported March 9, four people who died were 80 years or older, one was in their 70s, two were in their 60 and one was in their 50s.\nAll had underlying medical conditions.\n\nMore Information:\nThe more detailed data summaries found on the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0are updated around 5 p.m. daily.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210310.17.33.33"}
