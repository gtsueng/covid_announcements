Over the course of 17 years, the couple have provided care to dozens of children for the County of San Diego.\nBut for Rita the commitment to caring for children in foster care started long before she and her husband became what is known as resource parents. Rita\u2019s mother was a resource parent for more than 20 years and Rita often helped drive the children to appointments or activities.\nRita enjoyed the experience so much that she and Juan decided to start their own journey as resource parents in 2004. Since then, they have cared for 70 children of all ages and they\u2019re not thinking of quitting anytime soon.\n\u201cI stay in touch with almost all of our foster children and it gives me so much joy to see them succeed,\u201d Rita said. \u201cA lot of them regularly visit or call, some of them now have families of their own and have brought over their children for dinner so we could meet them.\u201d\nToday, Rita and Juan have five children in their care. The children\u2019s ages range from 4 to 12 years old. While no one day is like the other, especially in the last year of COVID-19 restrictions, they love the variety the children bring into their lives.\n\u201cDuring the week the children are all doing virtual learning and we help them with their classes and homework,\u201d Rita said. \u201cOn the weekends we like to take the kids to the beach or to SeaWorld. We really want our foster children to feel like they\u2019re part of the family, so we make sure we give them some of the experiences our own three kids had when they were growing up.\u201d\n\u201cMany foster children lack a strong support system and foster families can make such a huge difference for those kids,\u201d Juan said. \u201cTo me and my wife, the love these children give is the best gift anyone could ask for.\u201d\nThe County of San Diego is always looking for new parents willing to open their home to a child or teen. Getting started is easy and the County offers orientation meetings on an ongoing basis to help families who are interested in fostering determine if they are a good fit.\nTo learn more about becoming a resource parent, visit sdcares4kids.com.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210527.12.15.51"}
