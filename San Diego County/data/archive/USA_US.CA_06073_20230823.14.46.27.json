More than 100,000 bags were gathered and used across the county.\u00a0 But now the storm has passed and clear skies have returned.\u00a0 That has led many to ask, \u201cWhat should I do with the sandbags now?\u201d\nThe experts at the County\u2019s Department of Public Works offer some answers to the sandbags question:\n\nWith rainy season approaching, consider keeping your sandbags for reuse. You could store them filled, or empty out the clean sand and store the bags away from sunlight in a covered, above-ground location.\nIf the used sandbags are not contaminated with foul water, chemicals, or petroleum products, rake the sand into soil, add it to planters, or use it for flowerbeds as a soil amendment.\nPlace the empty bags in trash cans if you choose not to reuse them. Do not place the empty sandbags in the recycle bin.\nIf you cannot reuse the sand or sandbags at home, take them directly to the landfill. Local landfills (Miramar, Sycamore, Otay, and Borrego Springs) can accept sandbags used for stormwater control during the recent storm. Do not put full sandbags in your trash cart, bins, or dumpsters, they are too heavy for disposal companies to collect.\nIf you see or suspect your sandbags are contaminated with sewage, chemicals, or petroleum products, handle them with protective gear, including gloves and protective eyewear. Dispose of them at select landfills or through a hazardous waste contractor.\u00a0 Please contact the landfill facility in advance as additional handling and paperwork will be required.\nResidents of cities or tribal lands should also check with their jurisdiction or trash contractor for any additional guidance.\n\nFor questions not covered here, unincorporated county residents can contact 1-877-R-1-EARTH or 1-877-713-2784.\nThanks for preparing for the storm.
