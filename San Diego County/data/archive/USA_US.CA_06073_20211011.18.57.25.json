They are expected to recover.\nThe County has notified the City of San Diego and will work with the city and potential exposure sites and homeless service providers to ensure good hygienic precautions, identify any additional cases and connect ill individuals to treatment and housing.\nA health advisory to local providers also has also been issued.\n\u201cShigellosis isn\u2019t usually serious, but in the wrong circumstances it can spread, and we want to ensure this vulnerable population is kept safe,\u201d said Seema Shah, M.D., medical director of HHSA\u2019s Epidemiology and Immunization Services branch.\nShigellosis is a contagious infection typically spread by contaminated surfaces, food or water, or sometimes person-to-person such as men who have sex with men (MSMs). In 2020, the County identified 243 total cases; to date in 2021, the County has identified 220.\nAlthough only a small number of organisms can make a person sick, casual contact is not the main way shigellosis bacteria are spread. Typical symptoms include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever and stomach cramps.\nThe infection is diagnosed with stool testing. Most people will recover fully without antibiotic treatment, though individuals with poor immune systems can develop life-threatening disease. If you have symptoms that resemble shigellosis, contact your primary care physician for assistance.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211011.18.57.25"}
