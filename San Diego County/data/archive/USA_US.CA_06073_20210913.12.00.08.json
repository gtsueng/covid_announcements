The initiative, a component of the new Live Well San Diego Youth Sector\u2019s year-long leadership program, paired local young people with County employees for a three-month period, during which they learned\u00a0about their mentor\u2019s job and about the role County government plays in the region.\nThe leadership program was created to amplify youth voices and foster youth\u00a0civic\u00a0engagement. It also empowers participants to provide input on issues that are important to young people in the region.\nThe youths who participated in the inaugural cohort of the mentorship program were placed in various divisions across the County, including health promotion, emergency services and parks and recreation.\nSixteen-year-old Nadeen Youhanan decided to apply for the mentorship program because it allowed her to meaningfully engage with County government while getting hands-on work experience.\n\u201cAs a current high school senior, it was the perfect way for me to get work experience and identify possible majors and careers that are of interest to me as I go into college,\u201d said Youhanan. \u201cMost importantly, I was able to connect with like-minded and talented youth and work with them in identifying ways to boost youth engagement within San Diego, as well as how we can support and improve our community.\u201d\nHer mentor, Justine Kozo, is the County\u2019s chief of the Office of Border Health. Kozo also oversees the County\u2019s Partner Relay, a joint initiative between Public Health Services and the Office of Emergency Services focused on improving emergency communications with non-English speaking communities.\n\u201cMany of our partners have told us that the communities they serve often rely on youth to understand what is happening during an emergency and also to translate important health and safety information for family members who may not speak or read English,\u201d said Kozo. \u201cThrough her internship research, Nadeen has created recommendations on how to partner with youth to improve this communication pathway.\u201d\nTwenty-year-old Beatriz \u201cB\u201d Yumul was excited to bring their diverse background to their internship at the County.\n\u201cAs a queer, nonbinary, first-generation, Filipinx, going into health care, I was excited to share my perspective and ideas,\u201d Yumul said.\nYumul managed the Live Well San Diego social media accounts and compiled biweekly e-blasts containing resources and opportunities for young people throughout the region, as part of their internship. In addition to Yumul\u2019s internship with the Live Well San Diego Youth Sector, they participated in a separate mentorship opportunity with Samantha Sonnich, a community health promotion specialist.\n\u201cMy favorite part was getting to connect with B and support their passions and interests and learn from each other\u2019s experience,\u201d said Sonnich. \u201cI learned a lot from my mentee including how technology can help promote diversity and inclusion, how to involve youth in County programs and efforts, and how passionate and creative the younger generation is.\u201d\nThe two met once a week for an hour to share successes and challenges and discuss topics related to the mentorship goals they had set together at the beginning of the program.\n\u201cAfter my time with the County this summer, I will be a lot more aware of the possibilities of what I could pursue professionally in the realm of public health and with the County,\u201d said Yumul. \u201cI will be sharing these resources and doing my part to increase awareness and familiarity between my peers and members of my communities.\u201d\nThe Live Well San Diego Youth Sector will begin recruitment for its next cohort of young leaders early next year. Kozo and Sonnich look forward to participating in future iterations of the program.\n\u201cThere are so many different careers through the County, and I\u2019m hoping that we continue to expand these opportunities to share our love for public service and inspire, learn from, and give space to younger generations,\u201d said Sonnich.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to incorporate work with youth leaders as their perspective is essential for constructive change and positive impact,\u201d said Kozo.\nTo learn more about the Live Well San Diego Youth Sector, visit www.livewellsd.org/youth.
