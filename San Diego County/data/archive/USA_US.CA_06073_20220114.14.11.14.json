People should use \u201cwet-cleaning\u201d methods instead to keep from breathing in the virus and getting sick.\nFinding hantavirus in wild rodents is not uncommon in San Diego County and there is no vaccine or cure for it. However, people rarely come into contact with hantavirus because wild rodents tend to live away from people.\nPeople can be exposed to hantavirus when wild rodents shed the virus in their urine, feces and saliva, the matter dries, is stirred into the air and people breathe it in.\nIf people find wild rodents, nests or signs of them in their living spaces and must clean, they should always use \u201cwet cleaning\u201d methods \u2014 using bleach or other disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags. They should NOT sweep or vacuum, which could stir hantavirus into the air where it could be inhaled.\nHere are tips for people to prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, and how to use wet-cleaning methods.\nAvoid Exposure to Hantavirus\n\nSeal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.\nEliminate rodent infestations immediately.\nAvoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.\nClean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.\n\nUse \u201cWet-cleaning\u201d Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus\n\nDo not sweep or vacuum infested areas.\nVentilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.\nUse rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent droppings, nests, contaminated traps, and surrounding areas and let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.\nClean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.\nPlace disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard in the trash.\nWash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.\nThoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.\n\nFor more information, contact the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality (DEHQ) at (858) 694-2888\u00a0or visit the\u00a0DEHQ hantavirus web page.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220114.14.11.14"}
