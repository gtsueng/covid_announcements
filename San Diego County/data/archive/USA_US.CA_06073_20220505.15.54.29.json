However, if you come into close contact with someone with COVID-19, you should:\n\nWear a mask around others for 10 days, even at home\nGet tested 3-5 days after the exposure\nMonitor for symptoms and stay home if you\u2019re ill\nIsolate and notify your close contacts if you test positive for COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 Treatment Available in San Diego\nIf you do get COVID-19, County health officials say treatment is available. Treatment can help prevent high-risk individuals from getting sick enough to need hospital services and even from dying from COVID.\nOral medications, in the form of pills, and monoclonal antibodies, in the form of an intravenous infusion, are available at multiple locations and community pharmacies across San Diego. Antiviral medications require a doctor\u2019s prescription and should be started within five days of developing symptoms of COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies should be given no more than seven days after the onset of symptoms.\nTo determine which treatment is best for you, talk to your doctor or health care provider, or call 2-1-1 to find a provider.
