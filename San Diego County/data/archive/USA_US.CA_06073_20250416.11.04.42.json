However, mosquitoes can pass the potentially deadly virus on to people by feeding on infected birds and then biting people.\nWest Nile virus\u2019 effect has been relatively mild in San Diego County in the past few years. Three or fewer people have tested positive annually since 2017. But it can still be dangerous, and people should avoid mosquitoes.\nThe larvicide drops are just one part of Vector Control\u2019s\u00a0Integrated Vector Management Strategy. County Vector Control also monitors approximately 1,600 potential mosquito-breeding areas each year and applies larvicide through a variety of techniques\u2014aerial drops, boats, trucks and hand-crews. It also gives out free mosquito-eating fish to the public, tracks down and treats neglected swimming pools, tests dead birds for West Nile virus, and monitors mosquito populations for potential mosquito-borne illnesses.\nPublic has Important Role to Play\nCounty Vector Control officials are also reminding people to help protect themselves from mosquitoes in and around their homes by finding and dumping out standing water to keep the pests from breeding.\nProtecting against mosquitoes has required more help from the public in recent years because invasive Aedes mosquitoes, or \u201cankle biter\u201d mosquitoes, have established themselves here. These mosquitoes prefer to live and breed around people\u2019s homes and yards, and can potentially transmit diseases not naturally found here, including Zika, dengue and chikungunya.\nCounty Vector Control officials said the best way people can protect themselves from mosquitoes is to follow their \u201cPrevent, Protect, Report\u201d guidelines.\nPrevent Mosquito Breeding\nDump out or remove any item inside or outside of homes that can hold water, such as plant saucers, rain gutters, buckets, garbage cans, toys, old tires, and wheelbarrows. Mosquitofish, available for free by contacting the Vector Control Program, may be used to control mosquito breeding in backyard standing water sources such as unmaintained swimming pools, ponds, fountains and horse troughs. For more tips, go to Vector Control\u2019s Prevention Toolkit website.\nProtect Yourself from Mosquito Bites\nProtect yourself from mosquito-borne illnesses by wearing long sleeves and pants or use insect repellent when outdoors. Use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Make sure screens on windows and doors are in good condition and secured to keep insects out.\nReport Increased Mosquito Activity and Dead Birds\nReport increased mosquito activity, stagnant, unmaintained swimming pools and other mosquito-breeding sources, as well as dead birds \u2014 including crows, ravens, jays, hawks and owls \u2014 to the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality\u2019s Vector Control Program by calling (858) 694-2888 or emailing vector@sdcounty.ca.gov.\u00a0\nIf you have checked around your home for standing water and are still experiencing mosquito issues, you can request an educational mosquito inspection by contacting the\u00a0Vector Control Program\u00a0at (858) 694-2888.\n\u00a0\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250416.11.04.42"}
