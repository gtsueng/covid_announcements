The event drew 117 parents or other supportive adults and allowed young people to reconnect and share a meal with them.\n\u201cProbation staff and leadership are proud to host engagement events that uplift the voices of our youth and honor those who stand by them during their journey of transformation,\u201d said Mike Whatley, a Probation division chief. \u201cBy fostering supportive relationships and celebrating family engagement events, opportunities like this help build the emotional foundation necessary for successful reintegration and long-term personal development.\u201d\nProbation also recognizes the invaluable role that positive support people play in the lives of our justice-involved youth. The person, or persons, invited may have been a parent, guardian, mentor or other meaningful figure.\nParticipating youth welcomed their chosen positive support person to the facility and had an opportunity to express their gratitude to them with a framed portrait of themselves, a rose, and a hand-written appreciation card, said Whatley.\nThe Probation and San Diego County Office of Education collaboration exemplify a shared commitment to restorative practices and youth rehabilitation.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250513.14.23.40"}
