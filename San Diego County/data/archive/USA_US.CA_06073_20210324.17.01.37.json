The case investigation identified six close contacts outside the woman\u2019s household.\nA second case of the P.1 or Brazilian variant was detected locally, but the person, who also had not been vaccinated, is not a San Diego County resident.\u00a0 Four cases of the P.1 coronavirus variant have been reported in California through March 19.\nThere is some evidence that the P.1 and other new variants are more easily spread, but the P.1 variant is not believed to cause more severe illness or increase the risk of death.\n\u201cSan Diegans should not be alarmed. The COVID-19 vaccines currently available do offer some protection against most of the variants,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cPeople should continue taking the preventive measures that work against all variants of the novel coronavirus.\u201d\nSan Diegans should do the following now more than ever:\n\nWear a mask\nWatch your distance from others\nWash your hands\nWhen it\u2019s your turn, get vaccinated\n\nThrough March 23, a total of 336 cases of the B.1.1.7, known as the UK variant, had been identified in the region. No cases of the variant first identified in South Africa have been reported in the region.\nA report on the COVID-19 variants is published every Wednesday at www.coronavirus-sd.com.\nVaccination Progress:\n\nNearly 1.6 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to the region, and more than 1.5 million have been logged as administered. This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.\nOf those vaccinated to date, more than 510,000 County residents, or 19% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nOverall, almost 840,000 County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccines. That\u2019s 31.2% of those eligible.\nThose receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s vaccination dashboard.

The County is in the Red Tier.\nCurrently, the testing positivity percentage is 2.4%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 3.4% and is also in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.\nWhile two of the three metrics qualify the County for the Orange Tier or Tier 3, the state assigns counties to the more restrictive tier.\nThe California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, March 30.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nFive new community outbreaks were confirmed March 23. Two in business settings, one in a faith-based setting, one in a restaurant/bar setting and one in a retail setting.\nIn the past seven days (March 15 through March 21), 15 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n11,282 tests were reported to the County on March 23, and the percentage of new positive cases was 2%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 2.7%. Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 11,203.\n\nCases, Hospitalizations and ICU Admissions:\n\n257 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County on March 23.
