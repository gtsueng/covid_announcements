To date, the number of CARE agreements in San Diego County is about double that of the other six pilot counties combined.\u00a0\n\u201cToday the County of San Diego\u2019s CARE Act program has been a major success. Talk about policy making a difference in people\u2019s quality of life,\u201d said Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Nora Vargas. \u201cWe applaud the incredible work of participants, and the CARE team that has done so much to support participants\u2019 well-being.\u201d\u00a0\nThe voluntary program provides another pathway to treatment for people ages 18 and older who are diagnosed with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders.\u00a0\nClients with a recent history of needing crisis services reduced their reliance on these kinds of services by two-thirds after enrolling in a CARE Agreement.\u00a0\n\u201cThey want to continue to see us to tell us how well they\u2019re doing, said Desirae Sanders, County Deputy Public Defender and Supervisor of the Mental Health Unit. \u201cThey want to see the judge and tell them how great it is. They want to talk about how they\u2019re feeling better. We\u2019ve had two graduates who have moved out of state and called to say I am doing so great thank you so much.\u201d\u00a0\nSince it started, the County has received more than 200 petitions from the courts. More than half of the petitions have been from family members who are trying to help loved ones get connected to care.\u00a0\n\u201cThe success of this pilot program is due to the excellence of the personnel, from various parts of government, and the community, coming together to create processes that work and change lives,\u201d said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of County Behavioral Health Services. \u201cWe are being tapped as the expert to teach other counties how to build this program as it expands to every county across the state.\u201d\u00a0\nWhile the program is not specifically focused on addressing the unsheltered population, more than half of the 71 agreements are with people who were unhoused at the time the agreement was filed. More than 80% have since been housed.\u00a0\nThe County began its CARE Act program on Oct. 1, 2023.\u00a0\nSan Diego\u2019s first CARE Court graduation took place in August of this year.\u00a0\nThe CARE Act gives people an active role in creating their own CARE agreement for mental health treatment and housing support.\u00a0\u00a0\nServices include assessment, services planning, case management, housing assistance, pre-employment and vocational services, psychiatry and medication management, co-occurring disorder services, peer services, and assistance building natural supports.\u00a0\u00a0\nFamilies, clinicians, first responders, and others can file a petition with the civil court to connect adults to court-ordered voluntary treatment if they meet criteria related to health and safety.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241024.16.29.37"}
