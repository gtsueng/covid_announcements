However, the time frame for when people should get a booster depends on which vaccine you received.\nFor people who were vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the CDC indicates the following groups are eligible for a booster shot at 6 months or more after their initial series:\n\n65 years and older\nAge 18+ who live in\u00a0long-term care settings\nAge 18+ who have\u00a0underlying medical conditions\nAge 18+ who work or live in\u00a0high-risk settings\n\nFor San Diegans who got the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, booster shots are also recommended for people 18 and older and who were vaccinated at least two months ago.\nWhile all three available COVID-19 vaccines have now been approved as boosters, people should stick to the vaccine they originally received. However, they may choose a different one if necessary.\n\u201cPeople should go with their past vaccine, when possible,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThey all continue to be very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death, even against the Delta variant which is widely circulating.\u201d\nVaccine supplies remain plentiful, both for those seeking initial doses and boosters for those who meet the criteria. People can get a booster through their medical provider, a retail pharmacy or a site operated by the County.
