Together they will design a data-based \u201crandomized evaluation\u201d of the County\u2019s Shallow Rental Subsidy Program.\nThe program looks to keep low-income seniors from becoming homeless by paying them a rent subsidy.\nRicardo Basurto-D\u00e1vila is the head of OEPA. He said the evaluation is just the kind of deeper data analysis the County wants to do to better assess programs and improve policies.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with J-PAL,\u201d said Basurto-D\u00e1vila. \u201cThis evaluation will help us understand if senior incentives work, if they keep people housed, and give us data about how to move forward.\u201d\nThe Shallow Rental Subsidy Program was approved by the County\u2019s Board of Supervisors in 2022. It is managed by the Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities in the County\u2019s Health and Human Services Agency.\nThe program is providing $500-a-month subsidies to low-income seniors who are rent-burdened and at risk of becoming homeless. The subsidies will be paid to the people\u2019s landlords for 18 months. The people in the program were selected by a random selection process from a pool of qualified applicants.\nA simple evaluation of the program would just track the people receiving the subsidies and record how many of them were able to remain in their homes. The randomized study will also measure and compare outcomes for people who receive the subsidies against a similar group of seniors who did not receive them.\n\u201cThis comparison gives us more confidence that the results of the study will reflect the actual impact of the program,\u201d Basurto-D\u00e1vila said.\nThe County created the Office of Evaluation, Performance and Analytics in 2021 to use modern analytics to sift through the County\u2019s vast collection of data in new ways; to look for patterns, trends and associations that can help leaders improve programs, services and policies.\nThat particularly includes top priorities including homelessness, mental health, equity and racial justice.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231129.11.08.54"}
