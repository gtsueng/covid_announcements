The campaign aims to educate people about the impact of TB around the world and efforts to prevent people from getting sick with the disease. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe San Diego County TB Elimination Initiative is working to end TB in the region. The County TB Control program is partnering with community organizations, healthcare providers, schools and others to teach people about TB and how to prevent it.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe County is also working with people who may be at risk of getting sick with TB and providing testing and treatment. The TB Elimination Initiative\u2019s Community of Practice recently received recognition as a 2024 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention TB Elimination Champion.\u00a0\n\u201cTB is a preventable and curable disease, and it takes all of us being aware of its symptoms in order to continue making strides toward its elimination,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., County public health officer. \u201cPublic Health Services can\u2019t do that alone, so World TB Day is an opportunity to thank partners and increase awareness.\u201d\u00a0\nSymptoms of active TB disease can include lasting cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss.\u202f By comparison, latent TB infection is asymptomatic and not contagious, but without preventive treatment people with latent TB infection are at risk for developing active TB disease in the future.\u00a0\nLast year, in San Diego County, 243 TB cases were reported.\u00a0 This represents a return to pre-pandemic levels; on average there were 244 cases from 2015-2019.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe County operates a TB Clinic at the North Central Public Health Center, 5055 Ruffin Road. Public Health Services also offers testing at regional\u202fpublic health centers\u202fthroughout the County.\u202f\u00a0\nTo expand the efforts of this work, the County, along with Champions for Health, hosted\u00a0the San Diego County TB Prevention Education and Community Engagement Summit\u202ftoday at the Southeastern Live Well Center.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nThe County Administration Center will be lit up in red in honor of World TB Day, on March 24, joining other entities around the country and as far away as Canada and Australia. \u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240322.16.59.34"}
