The department cross-referenced geographic, economic, and populations statistics to identify key areas where the flyers would most likely be able to reach their target audience.\n\u201cThis was the first time our office used mass communication tools for outreach beyond existing case participants, and we carefully tailored the language and imagery in each flyer to address the needs of that community in the context of the child support program, said Eaton\u201d\nDuring the first three months, DCSS sent flyers to nearly 200 schools resulting in a total of 330,987 emails. And 34% of the emails were opened, which is much higher than the 21% industry standard for government emails.\n\u201cThis impressive open rate may be because emails from schools are more familiar and trusted by parents,\u201d said Eaton.\nJeff Grissom, Director of San Diego County DCSS, said the flyers and outreach materials that received the most clicks were ones that included a list of services in easily understood terminology on programs and services that matter most to our community.\n\u201cOur website, which is available in both Spanish and English, also received a 22% increase in Spanish-speaking visitors over the previous year,\u201d said Grissom. \u201cAnd we experienced modest but noteworthy growth of Spanish-speaking new case openings and engagement.\u201d\nGrissom said the office plans on continuing to use Peachjar to complement its website and Facebook and Twitter presence.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210208.16.20.33"}
