As part of the plan, the pedestrian safety data was gathered and ranked in each community.\nBuilding on these efforts, to enhance the region\u2019s transportation system, the County also developed a Local Roadway Safety Plan to help identify roadway intersections with the highest safety needs to reduce injury and fatal collisions on the roads.\nAmong the four intersections listed below, there have been 12 reported pedestrian-involved collisions within underserved communities from January 2015 to December 2019.\n\nJamacha Road and Elkelton Boulevard (La Presa/Spring Valley)\nSweetwater Road and Troy Street (Spring Valley)\nSouth Mission Road and West Alvarado Street (Fallbrook)\nSouth Mission Road and Clemmens Lane (Fallbrook)\n\nThe intersections are also part of the County\u2019s General Mobility Element, which provides a framework for a balanced transportation system for people within the unincorporated areas.\nThese intersections are located on essential roadways that provide access within the unincorporated areas, which requires these roadways to be safe and efficient.\nInstalling high-visibility crosswalks, curb ramps, audible and tactile pushbuttons, and pedestrian countdown signal heads will improve accessibility and safety for pedestrians, including children and individuals with vision or hearing loss.\nThe purpose of providing pedestrian connections that are safe and continuous is to support and encourage people to walk for everyday trips. Active modes of travel are increasingly recognized as an important way of improving public health, incorporating sustainable practices, and increasing the quality of life in communities.\nThe total estimated project cost is $958,554, including design, environmental review, and construction support. Construction is scheduled to begin by June 2024 and completed by August 2024.\nThe following 17 locations in the unincorporated communities of Spring Valley, La Presa, Bonita, Valley Center, Ramona, Fallbrook, Jamul, and El Cajon were identified in the Local Roadway Safety Plan for the implementation of pedestrian safety that include accessible pedestrian pushbuttons that beep/vibrate, and pedestrian countdown signal heads.\n\nAustin Dr. and Sweetwater Spring Blvd. (Spring Valley, District 4)\nLoma Ln. and Sweetwater Springs Blvd. (Spring Valley, District 4)\nElkelton Blvd. and Paradise Valley Rd.
