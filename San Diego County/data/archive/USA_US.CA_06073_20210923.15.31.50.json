To earn accreditation, park operators must meet 36 of the 154 standards that are deemed \u201cfundamental,\u201d and at least 85% of the remaining 118.\nThe County Department of Parks and Recreation is one of just 192 parks agencies nationwide \u2014 and one of four in California \u2014 to earn the recognition.\nThe department\u2019s accreditation is even more impressive because of the sheer size and scope of the county\u2019s system.\nParks and Recreation operates 152 facilities on 56,000 acres of land, including parks, camping parks, sports parks, community centers, nature centers open space preserves, historic sites and 380 miles of trails from the coast to the valleys to the desert.\nParks\u2019 programs and services run the gamut, from all types of events \u2014 such as Halloween, Earth Day, yearly egg hunts and weddings \u2014 to educational demonstrations about nature and the environment; fishing and boating; Track Trails that encourage kids to enjoy getting outside and hiking by using their smart phones to track their progress in online nature journals; learning and practicing bike skills; camping and even enjoying Summer Movies in the Park\u00a0and other cool fun.\nThe accreditation process required two years of preparation by County Park\u2019s leaders and staff, including extensive self-assessment, and gathering and organizing data and documents to demonstrate best practices in all parts of the department. The information was evaluated by industry professionals working on behalf of the commission.\nFor more information about the County\u2019s parks and recreation system, places to go and things to do, go to the https://www.sdparks.org/.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210923.15.31.50"}
