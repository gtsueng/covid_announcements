The Environmental Protection Agency says that in addition to polluting the air, greenhouse gases trap heat, make the planet warmer and contribute to climate change.\nThe Air Pollution Control District\u2019s contribution came from Carl Moyer grants, a program the state created in 1998 to help reduce pollution and toxic emissions.\nThe grants, which have become part of the County\u2019s Clean Air for All campaign, are used to reimburse selected businesses, local governments, schools and utilities for swapping out high-polluting, heavy-duty equipment for low-polluting or zero-polluting vehicles, boats, transportation and machinery.\nIn August, the Air Pollution Control District selected projects from 49 organizations to be eligible to receive $21.3 in grants funded by California\u2019s Air Resources Board and Department of Motor Vehicles that would eliminate 692 tons of greenhouse gas and pollution out of local skies.\nOrganizations must sign contracts to start their projects and are reimbursed once their projects are completed.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210217.10.53.35"}
