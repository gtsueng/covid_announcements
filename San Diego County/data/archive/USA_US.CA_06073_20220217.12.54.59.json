Among its findings, the report found disparities in how minorities were treated. The Sheriff\u2019s Department issued a response disputing those conclusions and questioned the analysis.\nThe public is invited to participate in the virtual town hall at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 22 at https://zoom.us/j/92431622262?pwd=WktGMXJMSjlxaGpiaXFLbks1N1NYUT09.
