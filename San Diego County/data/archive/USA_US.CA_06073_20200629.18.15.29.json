At the end of April, 15% of all cases reported were in people in that age range. Now, that percentage has increased to 22%.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that more young people are going out and not following the public health guidance. That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing more community outbreaks,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThey are going to bars, restaurants and having house parties and not wearing a mask or maintaining physical distance.\u201d\nAnother group showing increasing percentages are those 10 to 19 years old. That percentage has risen from 2.4% in late April to almost 6% currently.\n\n\u201cPeople are going out in larger numbers and interacting with people outside their household,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cWhile younger people have less severe symptoms from COVID-19, it\u2019s important to note that they could be spreading the virus to others who are more vulnerable.\u201d\nFor people in their 30s, the percentage of positive cases has remained steady, and in older demographics the percentage has been steadily decreasing.\n\u201cOlder people are heeding the public health advice and staying away from crowded places to avoid getting the virus,\u201d Wooten said.\n\nYour Actions Can Save Lives\nThe best way to prevent getting COVID-19 is to follow the public health guidance being issued by state and local health officials.\n\u201cOur actions have power and can save lives,\u201d Wooten said.\nSan Diegans must do the following to protect themselves and the public\u2019s health and keep other sectors of the economy from being closed:\n\nPractice good hand hygiene and sanitation\nKeep six feet apart\nWear a face covering\nAvoid crowded places\nStay home if they are sick\n\nCOVID-19 Tests, Cases and Deaths\nCommunity Outbreaks:\n\nIn the past seven days, seven community outbreaks were identified; two new outbreaks were identified June 28 at two local restaurants.\nThe number of community outbreaks hits the trigger of seven in seven days.\n\nTesting:\n\n6,908\u00a0tests were reported to the County June 28 and 7% were positive new cases.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests is\u00a04.1%.\u00a0\n\nCases:\n\nA record 498 new cases were reported in San Diego County for a total of 13,832.\n1,754\u00a0or\u00a012.7% of cases have required hospitalization.\n481\u00a0or\u00a03.5% of all cases and 27.4% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nNo new COVID-19 deaths were reported. The region\u2019s total remains at 361.\n\nMore COVID-19 Information\nMore information on COVID-19 and detailed data summaries can be found at the County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200629.18.15.29"}
