The land is located nearby the County\u2019s existing Cactus County and Louis A. Stelzer parks, and its future $18 million Lakeside Equestrian Park.\nSupervisor Joel Anderson, who represents the County\u2019s second district that includes Lakeside, said he was excited about the project and that the $6.44 million will help restore the land to its pristine nature and let people enjoy and hike through it.\nBoard Chair Nathan Fletcher said the project could also provide an important piece of the planned San Diego River Park Regional Trail.\n\u201cThis can be a wonderful regional asset,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cOf particular importance it also helps us with another step toward completing the San Diego River Park \u2014 this is the vision of 52 miles of interconnected walkways and bikeways (running) all the way from Ocean Beach to the mountains. This is an incredible opportunity and this is one piece of that puzzle, a section of that that we can complete.\u201d\nThe $6.44 million the Board of Supervisors agreed to use to restore the property Wednesday would spend:\n\n$2,641,000 to improve and expand the existing Little League ballfield, including rehabilitating the existing field and adding new accessible pathways, restrooms and parking improvements, replacing the existing concession building and restrooms, irrigation and amenities like bleachers and tables.\n$800,000 on trails, including design, environmental work and trail construction.\n$3 million to restore habitat, including removing invasive species like tamarisk, pepper and eucalyptus trees, and planting and seeding with native vegetation that would include a five-year maintenance and monitoring plan.\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210303.14.57.35"}
