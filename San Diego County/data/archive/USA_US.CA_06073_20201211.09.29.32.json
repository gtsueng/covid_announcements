That has happened too many times for him, seven times in fact \u2013 when people came in, fell in love with his looks and then returned him when they were unable to meet his needs as an active dog.\n\u201cHe just needs a patient, compassionate new owner that is willing to commit to addressing his special needs,\u201d said Kelly Campbell, Director of the Department of Animal Services. \u201cWe here at the County of San Diego Department of Animal Services would like to find the perfect adopter or foster family for Houdini. It would have to be a person or persons who are active, experienced with the breed, experienced with dog training and willing to be dedicated to helping Houdini become the best dog that he can be.\u00a0 We truly believe he has the potential to be an amazing addition to the family, if he could only find his perfect, devoted companion.\u201d\nSo, what is his story? He earned his name at DAS after the first family to take him in, returned him for his uncanny ability to escape. He\u2019d even jump out of a second story window taking the screen down with him. Houdini\u2019s adventurous nature may also have given some of his previous owners the wrong impression. He had been returned several times because \u00a0he seemed unable to quickly form a bond with his new owner. But to be fair to Houdini, many of his adoptions were relatively short, most of them a matter of days Having been through six previous families, it is entirely possible Houdini viewed his adoptions as a mini adventure and his \u201chome\u201d as the shelter.\nDonald Davis, a supervising animal attendant who works with Houdini regularly, said he is not the same dog who jumped out of the window. Davis said he has mellowed out some since that occurred, but Houdini still has a lot of energy. Animal services officers call him an \u201cextreme\u201d husky, meaning he exhibits all his breed-specific traits which include being vocal, having a high energy level, having limited patience, and shedding a lot. His high energy level would be perfect for a running companion or someone with a large, fully enclosed and very secure backyard. He understands and responds to commands and would be trainable with the right person.\nIn fact, DAS has a trainer who has evaluated his personality and is willing to work with whoever adopts or fosters him at no cost to the adopter through the Spirit Fund, \u00a0which helps animals with veterinary or behavioral needs.\nDue to COVID-19 precautions, DAS is offering touchless adoptions. If you would like to submit your application to be considered to adopt or foster Houdini, please visit the DAS website www.sddac.com and follow the instructions to complete and submit an adoption or foster care application. Houdini\u2019s digits are Kennel 51, Tag Number 969 and Animal Identification Number A1868183.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20201211.09.29.32"}
