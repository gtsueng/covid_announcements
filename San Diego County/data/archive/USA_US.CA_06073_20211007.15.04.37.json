It gives them a sense of control.\u201d\nSelf-swabbing also allows for improved social distancing between patients and County workers, Foster said. When properly done, it does not affect accuracy.\nStill, if people are not comfortable swabbing their own nose, County testing sites have clinicians who are ready to step in and conduct the test.\nA pilot effort in September at the Border View testing location worked well and proved popular with most customers. The County then started rolling it out to all its locations \u2014including sites for County employees\u2014 since they were very well received.\n\u201cA very high percentage of people prefer it,\u201d Foster said. \u201cThey feel less anxious.\u201d\nResults from a COVID-19 test at a County site are typically available within 24 to 48 hours.\nIf you are experiencing\u00a0symptoms of COVID-19, you are encouraged to contact your health care provider to get tested for the virus. No-cost testing is also available at several County locations across the region. You can find testing sites\u00a0by day or by location.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211007.15.04.37"}
