It can also be a meditative time to refocus and set a positive goal.\nThe Spartan Race is an \u201cultimate obstacle course challenge\u201d with 20 challenges designed to test a runner\u2019s physical and mental limits.\n\u201cMost of the youth are first-time runners when they join the club. They embrace the challenge that running presents and often support and motivate one another during training sessions and races,\u201d said Supervising Probation Officer Carlos Sanchez.\n\u201cThe shared experience fosters a strong sense of camaraderie and connection among the participants.\u201d\nSo that they don\u2019t miss out on any court-mandated or school-related programming, the youth wake up at 5 a.m. to train with an officer three times a week. The training focuses on long-distance running and speed workouts at the Youth Transition Campus track.\nThe event was held in honor of military service members and first responders.\nAfter completing the race, which they all completed in over an hour \u2013 a few did it in 1 hour and 5 minutes \u2013 the exhausted and exhilarated youth grabbed lunch with the officers. The running club program has a small budget to register students for races and buy lunch. Several staff members accompany the runners when they participate in the community events.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250429.10.00.51"}
