The San Diego Housing Commission will determine how best to meet the needs of their residents including how much support each individual will receive. The County finalized a similar agreement with National City. The National City Housing Authority received more than $360,000 in County grant funds to help their residents successfully transition out of the County Emergency Temporary Lodging Program.\n\u201cThis is the next step in helping our neighbors recover from the January flood,\u201d said Emergency Services Director Jeff Toney. \u201cThe County program to provide hotel rooms ends June 21, and we want to make sure the experts at the city housing agencies have what they need to help their residents find the appropriate long-term housing solutions.\u201d\nThe County Board of Supervisors allocated money for the San Diego Housing Commission, the National City Housing Authority, and the Housing Authority of the County of San Diego to help families leaving the County program secure alternate housing solutions. More than 300 residents in the County program have also received FEMA assistance to help with home repair or rental assistance.\nFor more information on the County\u2019s Emergency Temporary Lodging Program, go to AlertSanDiego.org/Recovery.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240605.15.58.40"}
