This was driven by better weather, according to the report.\nHowever, \u201cBedding Plants, Color & Perennials, Cacti & Succulents\u201d reign supreme again this year as the top crop in the county, bringing in a total of $445,359,543, which is 25% of the total value of agriculture production in the county!\nOrnamental Trees & Shrubs decreased from $382 million in 2021 to $375 million, but still ranked No. 2 on the annual Top 10 crops grown in San Diego.\nNursery & Cut Flower Products, Apiary Products and Field Crops dropped in value partially due to less acreage and demand for the products. Despite this decrease, San Diego retains its No. 1 ranking in Nursery & Cut Flower products in California.\nThe overall acreage devoted to commercial agriculture went from 219,874 acres in 2021 to 214,438 acres in 2022; a decrease of about 5,000 acres or 2.5%.\nThe report provides a yearly snapshot of agriculture\u2019s contribution to the region\u2019s economy, despite new challenges like the COVID pandemic and longstanding ones like the region\u2019s inclement weather, rising water costs, wildfires, freezes and pests.\nThe County conducts about 1,500 inspections annually where pesticides used, whether it\u2019s a farm, business park or a residential location. As a result, the County has seen a compliance rate of about 90% for pesticide inspections conducted in 2022.\nSupervisor Jim Desmond serves as the representative for the Fifth Supervisorial District in the County, a region abundant with the agricultural resources.\nSupervisor Desmond emphasized the County\u2019s strong commitment to safeguarding pesticide usage across all communities by allocating approximately $5 million from the County\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures\u2019 (AWM) annual budget for this vital endeavor.\n\u201cIt is truly an honor to hold the position of District Five Supervisor and it is immensely gratifying to witness the thriving agricultural landscape within our district,\u201d Desmond remarked.\nOther notable information from the report includes:\n\n\u201cHoney & Beeswax\u201d saw the greatest percentage increase in value from 2021 to 2022, rising 724%, from $79,023 to $651,295, as the apiary industry recovered from the impacts of drought. Honey production increased likely due to favorable weather conditions and increased forage.\n\u201cLivestock & Poultry\u201d products saw the second largest value increase in 2022 of $39 million.\n\u201cIndoor Flowering & Foliage plants\u201d remained third in the Top 10, however, value decreased by 13%, from roughly $356 million in 2021 to $311 million.\nThe overall value of Citrus increased by 20% compared to last year, despite a 5% decrease in acreage, due to a spike in price and better weather.\n\nAWM compiles the Crop Report each year and publishes it online.\nThis is the first year that the County\u2019s Crop Report will feature an interactive version for the public to engage with the report in new ways, including an integrated Google Translate feature to read the report in multiple languages.\nHere is a look at the 2022 Top 10 Crops:\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231023.09.19.14"}
