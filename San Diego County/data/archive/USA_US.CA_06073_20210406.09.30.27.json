For the latest results on election night, you can follow the Registrar\u2019s office on Twitter.\nThe final unofficial election night results may not come in until midnight and will only cover the ballots that could be counted immediately.\nHere\u2019s what will remain to be counted.\nMail ballots. The Registrar\u2019s office mailed over 300,000 ballots for this election and a portion of those could be dropped off at the polls or picked up by the U.S. Postal Service on Election Day. Plus, mail ballots sent right before or on April 6 have three days to arrive if postmarked by Election Day.\nThen there are provisional ballots. People who missed the March 22 registration deadline may conditionally register and vote provisionally up to and on Election Day.\nFor each provisional ballot, election workers must make sure the voter didn\u2019t already cast a ballot.\nHowever, the results must be certified on April 15, and the Registrar expects to use every minute of the certification period to make sure the results are accurate.\nFor more information, visit sdvote.com or call (858) 565-5800.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210406.09.30.27"}
