Wooten. M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cSome parents have been eagerly anticipating the COVID vaccine for their younger kids. They should make an appointment to get them vaccinated as soon as possible.\u201d\nSmaller Doses for Younger Kids\nThe vaccines for children this age would be given in much smaller doses. The Pfizer vaccine would be given in three shots, each containing one tenth of an adult dose. The first two doses would be given three weeks apart and the final shot at least three months later.\nThe Moderna vaccine, which currently is only available for adults, is also likely to be approved for two more age groups: children between 6 and 17 years of age and those under 6. The Moderna shot for kids under 6 is a two-dose series, given about four weeks apart. Each dose contains one quarter of the adult dose.\nBoth the Pfizer and Moderna shots for kids under 6 are given with smaller needles and, most times, it is administered in the leg.\nEveryone 5 years and older can get a vaccine and boosters at no cost. Parental consent\u00a0is required for all eligible minors to be vaccinated.\nVaccination Progress:\n\nReceived at least one shot: More than 2.97 million or 94.4% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.\nFully vaccinated: Over 2.63 million or 83.6%.\nBoosters administered: 1,358,992 or 58.7% of 2,316,581 eligible San Diegans.\nMore vaccination information can be found at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.\n\nDeaths:\n\nThree additional deaths were reported since the last report on June 9.

They died between June 9, 2022 and June 11, 2022; the three deaths occurred in the past week.\nTwo of the people who died were 80 years or older and one was in their 70s.\nTwo of the people who died were fully vaccinated and one was not.\nAll three had underlying medical conditions\n\nCases, Case Rates, Hospitalizations and Testing:\n\n4,003 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past three days (June 13 \u2013 June 15, 2022).
