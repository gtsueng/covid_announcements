This year\u2019s goal is 501 pints of blood.\nEach one-pint bag has the potential to help up to three people.\n\u201cThe blood donated saves lives,\u201d said Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Nora Vargas. \u201cIt is critically needed by those experiencing complications of childbirth, newborns in the NICU, persons with cancer, and those suffering traumas such as burns or serious accidents.\u201d\nHealth and Human Services Agency Interim Director Dr. Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., has seen the impact donors make in his professional, and personal, life.\n\u201cI got a phone call and knew in that moment my mother needed to get to a hospital immediately,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThose doctors and the blood transfusion she received made it possible for her to be with us today.\u201d\nAs an emergency physician, McDonald knows how critical it is to have a diverse supply of blood.\n\u201cCertain blood types and surface proteins are unique to specific groups,\u201d he said. \u201cMatching your ethnic background to a donor can lessen the likelihood of a reaction from a blood transfusion.\u201d\nTo champion expanded blood donations, the County and Blood Bank three years ago created the Community Guardians Program.\nIn the last two years 12 Live Well San Diego partner organizations have joined the Community Guardians Program, stepping up to promote donations.\n\u201cOur partners at San Ysidro health hosted blood drives in their San Ysidro and El Cajon locations, collecting over 100 pints of blood in San Diego\u2019s most diverse communities,\u201d County Assistant Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jennifer Tuteur, M.D. said. \u201cThe San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, engaged, educated, and motivated their 2,500 members and more than 300,000 employees to donate blood. We appreciate everyone\u2019s support and welcome more organizations to sign on as partners.\u201d\nThe Blood Bank said it faces pressures daily to meet the local need for blood.\n\u201cThe San Diego Blood Bank currently is low on most types and must collect more than 350 pints of blood every day just to meet our region\u2019s growing need for blood and blood products,\u201d said San Diego Blood Bank CEO Doug Morton.\nCounty employees are dedicated to supporting the local blood supply, and in the case of Mary-Huyen, Cecilia, and Sara, found themselves or a loved one on the live changing side of donations.\nEveryone is welcome, including non-County employees, to sign up to donate.\nBlood Drives at County of San Diego Locations\nCAC INAUGURATION EVENT \u2013 County Administration Center\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nTuesday, April 2, 2024 | 9:30 am \u2013 3:00 pm\u00a0\u00a0\nNorth Coastal Family Resource Center (Oceanside)\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nTuesday, April 2, 2024 | 10:00 am \u2013 2:00 pm\nCounty Operations Center \u2013 Kearny Mesa\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nThursday, April 4, 2024 | 9:00 am \u2013 3:00 pm\nCounty of SD HHSA \u2013 South Region\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nThursday, April 4, 2024 | 9:00 am \u2013 2:30 pm\nSan Diego Superior Court and County\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nThursday, April 4, 2024 | 11:00 am \u2013 4:30 pm\nFallbrook Community Center\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\u00a0\nMonday, April 8, 2024 | 11:00 pm \u2013 4:00 pm\nCounty of San Diego \u2013 Department of Public Works\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nTuesday, April 9, 2024 | 8:30 am \u2013 1:00 pm\nLakeside Branch Library\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nTuesday, April 9, 2024 | 11:00 am \u2013 4:30 pm\nEast Region Live Well Center\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nWednesday, April 10, 2024 | 9:00 am \u2013 2:30 pm\nNorth Central Family Resource Center\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nWednesday, April 10, 2024 | 9:00 am \u2013 2:30 pm\nEdgemoor Hospital DPSNF \u2013 Santee\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nThursday, April 11, 2024 | 9:00 am \u2013 2:30 pm\nSouth Region Live Well Center\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nThursday, April 11, 2024 | 8:30 am \u2013 1:30 pm\nVista Library\u00a0| BOOK NOW\nThursday, April 11, 2024 | 12:00 pm \u2013 5:00 pm\nCounty Health & Human Services \u2013 Lemon Grove\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nFriday, April 12, 2024 | 10:00 am \u2013 3:30 pm\nNorth Inland Live Well (Escondido)\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nMonday, April 15, 2024 | 9:00 am \u2013 2:00 pm\nSouth Eastern Live Well Center (Lemon Grove)\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nMonday, April 15, 2024 | 8:30 am \u2013 1:30 pm\nCounty of San Diego HHSA \u2013 North Central/Residential\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nTuesday, April 16. 2024 | 8:00 am \u2013 1:30 pm\nLive Well Support Center \u2013 Seville Plaza\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nWednesday, April 17, 2024 | 9:30 am \u2013 3:00 pm\nCounty of San Diego \u2013 Housing and Community Development Services\u00a0|\u00a0BOOK NOW\nThursday, April 18, 2024 | 9:00 am \u2013 2:30 pm\nJohn F.
