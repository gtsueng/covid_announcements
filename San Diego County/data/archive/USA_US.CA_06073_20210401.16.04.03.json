Because of that, students at the schools and districts \u2014 using just their students IDs \u00ad\u2014 can check out the County Library\u2019s wider collection of age-appropriate digital materials.\nCounty Library Director Migell Acosta said the collaboration will give students a lot more to read, whether it\u2019s to borrow educational materials or books for their own personal reading pleasure.\n\u201cThis collaboration aims to promote literacy and education,\u201d Acosta said, \u201cby providing a wide range of resources to students who don\u2019t have a library card yet but could greatly benefit from the San Diego County Library\u2019s vast collection. We are excited to open up our digital collection to young residents who couldn\u2019t previously take advantage of it.\u201d\nThe County Library already has a large digital following, offering e-books, audio books and e-magazines around the clock, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to its patrons who download the\u00a0Libby app, which like the Sora app, is also made by the company OverDrive. In 2020, the County Library\u2019s digital circulation increased 56% to more than 3.2 million books and materials.\nCounty officials said school districts in the County\u2019s service area that would like to give their students greater access should contact OverDrive to sign up for Sora.\nThe schools and districts that are part of the Library\u2019s Sora partnership are:\n\nAlbert Einstein Academy Charter School K-8\nAlpine Union School District K-8\nBonsall Unified School District K-12\nCajon Valley Union School District K-8\nCardiff School District K-6\nCarlsbad Unified School District K-12\nEpiphany Prep Charter School K-5\nFallbrook Union Elementary School District K-8\nGrossmont Union High School District 9-12\nHelix Charter High School 9-12\nJamul-Delzura Union School District K-8\nKing-Chavez Neighborhood of Schools K-12\nSan Diego Unified School District 6-8\nPoway Unified School District K-12\nSan Dieguito Unified High School District 7-12\nSan Marcos Unified School District K-12\nSan Pasqual Union School District K-8\nSouth Bay Union School District\nValley Center-Pauma Unified School District K-12\n\nFor more information about the County library, go to the Library\u2019s\u00a0webpage.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210401.16.04.03"}
