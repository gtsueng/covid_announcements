Additional updates are at the discretion of the Registrar of Voters.\nElection results must be certified by May 8. For this special election, the Registrar expects certification to occur on an earlier date, while making sure every legally cast vote is added to the count in the most expeditious, yet careful manner available, ensuring accurate results. All updates will be posted on sdvote.com with the final certified results posted by May 8.\nLearn more about voting in the District 1 special primary election at sdvote.com, or call (858) 565-5800 or toll free at (800) 696-0136.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250408.08.00.00"}
