Under the Voter\u2019s Choice Act, vote centers replace traditional polling places.\nVote centers are open throughout the county for an extended period before Election Day. Rather than a single day of service, poll workers are now needed to staff vote centers for up to 11 days in the two weeks before Election Day.\nDepending on the assignment, poll workers will receive a stipend ranging from $135 to $160 for each day of service at a vote center between Feb. 24 and March 4.\nOn Election Day, March 5, poll workers will receive a stipend ranging from $220 to $270 due to the extended hours. Those who are bilingual will receive an additional $5 for each day of service at the vote center with an increase to $10 on Election Day.\nResponsibilities include:\n\nProviding excellent customer service\nAssisting voters\nSubmitting stipend paperwork\nAttending a two-day, paid poll worker training ($95 daily stipend)\nOpening/closing a vote center\nAnswering voter questions\n\nApplicants must be 18 years old, a U.S citizen and registered to vote in California, or lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States. Applicants must also provide their own transportation to their assigned vote center.\nThe Registrar is seeking people who are team players, exhibit strong leadership and customer service skills, and display flexibility, patience and the highest level of integrity at all times. Poll workers must represent the Registrar of Voters in a professional, nonpartisan manner.\nApplications are available at sdvote.com.
