Based on available information, there is no evidence to show that these two exposures are related, at this time. These exposures are also unrelated to other recently announced TB exposures in our community.\nThe dates of potential exposure at the Mission Valley location, located at 1233 Camino Del Rio S, San Diego, CA, 92108, are from January 4, 2023, to February 22, 2023. Members believed to be at highest risk at the Mission Valley location have been individually notified.\nThe dates of potential exposure at the Chula Vista location, located at 1030 3rd Ave., Chula Vista, CA, 91911, are from February 1, 2023, to April 30, 2023. Individual members at risk from exposures at the Chula Vista location have not been able to be defined. However, members who attended the location during the afternoons are believed to be at highest risk.\nPeople sick with TB may be sick for many months before they are diagnosed, and as such, exposure periods can be long.\nTB is an airborne disease that is transmitted from person-to-person through inhalation of the bacteria from the air.\u00a0 The chance of infection is higher for people with frequent and prolonged indoor exposure to a person who is sick with TB.\n\u201cSymptoms of active TB include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cMost people who become infected after exposure to tuberculosis do not get sick right away. This is called latent TB infection. Some who become infected with TB will become ill in the future, sometimes even years later, if their latent TB infection is not treated. Blood tests and skin tests are effective to determine whether someone has been infected.\u201d\nPeople who test positive for TB but who don\u2019t have symptoms of active TB should get a chest x-ray and talk to a medical provider, as they most likely have a latent TB infection. \u00a0People in this situation are infected with TB, but the infection is essentially dormant or \u201csleeping.\u201d Taking medicines for latent TB infection can cure the infection and keep these people from getting sick.\nIt is important for individuals with symptoms of active TB and those who are immune-compromised to see medical provider to rule-out active tuberculosis and to discuss treatment.\nThe number of people diagnosed with active TB in San Diego County has decreased since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years. There were 192 in 2020 and 201 people reported with active disease in 2021. Preliminary data shows 208 people were reported to have active TB disease in 2022.\nIndividuals who would like more information on this potential exposure should call the County TB Control Program at (619) 692-5565.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230915.10.16.24"}
