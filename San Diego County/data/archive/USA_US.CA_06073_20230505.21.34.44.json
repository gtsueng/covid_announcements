The Hi-Lo siren is distinct from those used when emergency officials are responding to an emergency call.\n\ufeff\nEmergency agencies want people to associate the loud and distinct\u00a0 siren with an urgent evacuation.\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Department notes they will only use this critical warning system to inform communities of an evacuation order in the event of natural disasters, extreme emergencies or critical incidents such as wildfires, flash floods, tsunamis, terrorism, bomb threats. It will be used also for SWAT standoffs, gas leaks, hazmat spills and sinkholes that pose a danger to the community.\nLaw enforcement just started installing the Hi-Lo system in Sheriff\u2019s patrol vehicles, but because it will be a new siren, officials wanted to make sure the public understands what it means and what they need to do if they hear it.\n\u201cWhen you hear the Hi-Lo, it is time to go! Heed the warning and evacuate immediately because your safety depends on it,\u201d it states in its public service announcement.\nThis will be one more emergency tool for the region. Traditional notification systems, such as AlertSanDiego phonecalls, loudspeaker announcement and door-to-door notification, will continue to be used.\nBeing prepared is key to staying safe.

Download the SD Emergency App to your smartphone to help you plan, prepare, get informed and recover from an emergency. The app is equipped with ShakeReadySD early earthquake warning.

Don\u2019t forget to register your cell phone to receive AlertSanDiego emergency notifications. Landline numbers are automatically included in the 9-1-1 database and will be called in an emergency, but many residents only use cell phones as a main contact and the number needs to be registered to your address to get emergency notifications.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230505.21.34.44"}
