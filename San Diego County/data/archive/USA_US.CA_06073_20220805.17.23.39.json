CAL FIRE/San Diego County Fire has a cooperative agreement to use the Sheriff\u2019s Bell 205 Type 2 initial attack helicopters and they have a 375-gallon capacity. The SIKORSKY CH-54A has a capacity to carry 2,650 gallons of water.\n\u201cThis is a tremendous amount of water available in one drop,\u201d said fire Capt. Frank LoCoco, CAL FIRE San Diego. \u201cIt allows us to fight these fires aggressively and keep them small.\u201d\nThe SIKORSKY CH-54A arrived in the County on Aug. 1 and is an exclusive use contract with CAL FIRE to respond as needed. It will operate out of the Ramona Airport.\nIn total, the region will have up to nine staffed firefighting helicopters and three planes, which are provided by the County, CAL FIRE, U.S. Forest Service, the City of San Diego and San Diego Gas & Electric. The partnership between County Fire, the Sheriff\u2019s Department and CAL FIRE, along with the coordination with regional partners, adds substantial fire suppression from the air to assist ground resources.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220805.17.23.39"}
