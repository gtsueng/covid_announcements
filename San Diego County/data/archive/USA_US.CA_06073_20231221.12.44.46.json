These measurements are a good indicator of cases to come.\u00a0\nAs always, vaccinations are the best protection and COVID-19 and flu vaccines are widely available at local pharmacies or medical providers.\u00a0\nTesting for COVID-19 and flu is also recommended. Doctors can prescribe medications to help people from getting severely sick, especially older adults or people with underlying medical conditions.\u00a0\nEveryone ages six months and older is eligible for the updated COVID-19 vaccine regardless of prior vaccination history as long as it has been two months since the last dose of any COVID-19 vaccine.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe flu vaccine is recommended yearly for everyone six months and older, especially people at higher risk for getting seriously sick like young children, older adults, pregnant people and people with certain health conditions.\u00a0\u00a0\nRSV or Respiratory Syncytial Virus is a common respiratory virus that can cause grave illness in young children and older adults with underlying illnesses. Pregnant people and people 60 years or older should talk with their doctor about whether the RSV vaccine is right for them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cStaying current on your vaccines is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from getting sick,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to go get your COVID-19 and flu vaccines as these viruses have not yet peaked this season.\u201d\u202f\u00a0\nIn addition to pharmacies and other locations, vaccines are also available at County public health clinics.\u202fCheck online\u202ffor the days and hours sites will be open.\u202f\u00a0\nPreventative Measures\u00a0\nBeyond vaccination and staying home when sick, San Diegans can take other precautions to protect themselves and others against COVID-19, the flu and RSV with these measures:\u202f\u00a0\n\nCleaning hands thoroughly and often.\u202f\u00a0\nStaying away from people who are sick.\u202f\u00a0\nCovering your cough and sneezes.\u00a0\nWearing a facial covering, especially in crowded indoor settings.\u202f\u00a0\nRegularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces.\u00a0\nDoing at-home tests when exposed to COVID-19 or when ill. The federal government is currently providing free at-home COVID-19 tests. Households can\u202forder a pack of four free tests\u202fthrough the U.S. Postal Service.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the\u202fRespiratory Virus Surveillance Report\u202fweekly.\u00a0\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231221.12.44.46"}
