The educational campaign includes radio announcements, outdoor billboards, and digital media to inform children, youth and their peers on how to protect themselves from exploitation.\nThe new campaign was announced today at a press conference by Chairwoman Nora Vargas, Supervisor Jim Desmond, and District Attorney Summer Stephan along with other County leaders.\nHuman trafficking occurs when a person is forced into sex acts or labor services for profit through violence, threats and false promises. The FBI reports San Diego is one of the nation\u2019s 13 hotspots for human trafficking.\n\u201cTrafficking of children and young people happens in all neighborhoods and victims can be any age, race, gender, or nationality,\u201d said Chairwoman Nora Vargas. \u201cLanguage barriers and fear too often keep victims silent and make trafficking a hidden crime.\u201d\nA recent study by two local universities estimates there are thousands of victims of trafficking annually here in San Diego and the average age of victims is 16 years old. Rarely is the victim kidnapped. Rather human traffickers are far more likely to lure their young victims by developing a relationship with the youth, oftentimes via social media.\n\u201cPredators target young girls and boys, subjecting them to a life of sexual exploitation through coercion and manipulation,\u201d said County Supervisor Jim Desmond. These victims are thrust into an abyss of despair, their dreams and aspirations shattered and replaced with unimaginable suffering.\u201d\nLaw enforcement and prosecution efforts alone are not enough to stop these human rights violations. Prevention through education, especially at a young age, is the best defense against exploitation, especially in this era of social media.\n\u201cTraffickers often groom, deceive and control their victims through online platforms\u201d said San Diego County District Attorney\u00a0Summer Stephan. \u201cOur youth need to be aware of predators posing as friends.\u201d\nThe County\u2019s media campaign will run this summer in English and Spanish from June through August.\nTo report suspected child abuse or neglect call the Child Abuse Hotline at 858-560-2191, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
