The financial support is earmarked for those leaving custody who have a history of behavioral health needs and are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The County will also leverage an additional $4 million for a total program of $10 million.\n\u201cThe goal of this grant and the work of the Community Care Coordination team is to help people leaving jail to gain independence, reduce criminal behavior and future returns to jail, and therefore improve public safety,\u201d said Andrea Pella, director of Prevention, Diversion and Re-Entry for San Diego County. \u201cThis program will provide connections to care and housing resources for those who may have otherwise been homeless upon their release from jail.\u201d\nThe proposed program is modeled after San Diego County\u2019s Community Care Coordination program that connects people to the services they need in the community.\u00a0 Prior to their release from jail, an adult in custody is referred to a team of clinicians and peer support specialists with lived experience.\u00a0 The team meets with the client, assesses their needs and helps connect them to community support like behavioral health services, housing, and employment opportunities.\u00a0 When released, the person will be transported by someone from the Community Care Coordination team directly to temporary housing.\u00a0 Soon after, the team connects the individual to behavioral health services for ongoing treatment.\u00a0 Additionally, the team will introduce clients to job opportunities, benefit assistance, reconnect them with family, and develop longer term housing plans.\n\u201cIt is a wonderful opportunity to expand the framework of an existing successful program and advance the goals of the Board-driven Alternatives to Incarceration work that City and County health and justice partners are working tirelessly on,\u201d Pella continues. \u201cI appreciate the local advisory committee and county health partners\u2019 commitment and collaboration to assist in the successful re-entry of our justice\u2013involved population into the community.\u201d\nThe program begins in September 2022 with a goal of serving 300 to 400 people before the grant period ends in June 2026.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220801.09.04.44"}
