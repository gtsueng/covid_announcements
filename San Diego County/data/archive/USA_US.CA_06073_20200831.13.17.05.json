They said law enforcement was crucial, but that society must collectively realize substance abuse disorder was a disease that can, and must, be beaten.\nAnd they urged people to act, to get help by calling the County\u2019s Access and Crisis line (1-888-724-7240) or 2-1-1 San Diego; to safely get rid of old prescription drugs at biannual Prescription Drug Take Back days or by taking them to local Sheriff\u2019s offices and fire stations; and to learn more about the overdose crisis at the San Diego Opioid Project.\nGaspar called on parents to go to their medicine cabinets to get rid of old prescription drugs that children can get to.\n\u201cImmediately, first step,\u201d Gaspar said, \u201clook in your medicine cabinet. Anything in there, expired, unused meds \u2014 we need to make every day prescription (drug) takeback day in San Diego County. Those can go immediately to your Sheriff\u2019s department \u2026 to a fire station, disposed of properly. They are dangerous.\u201d\nStephan and others said overdose deaths plague San Diego County like the rest of the nation. She said fentanyl deaths in particular have become a rising problem, due in part to drug dealers \u201clacing\u201d other various illegal drugs with deadly fentanyl. She said fentanyl-related deaths have increased in San Diego County from 152 in all of 2019, to 203 in just the first six months of 2020.\nDr. Bergmann said that the COVID 19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem because people who are stressed and turning to substance abuse feel disconnected from care. But he said advancements in telehealth means that anyone can get help, and he urged people who were struggling, or who had loved ones struggling with addiction issues to call.\n\u201cIf you can get access to a phone,\u201d Bergmann said, \u201cyou can get care. And there\u2019s not a better day, I would say, to begin a recovery journey than today.\u201d\nSome of the other comments from Monday\u2019s speakers included:\n\nGaspar said she strongly supported the Methamphetamine Strike Force and Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force initiatives, and that the County\u2019s new $6.5 billion budget directed $100 million to address COVID and all its impacts. Gaspar said that included an additional $15 million for technology needed for behavioral health such as telehealth, outreach and engagement, and workforce recruitment and retention.\nUS Attorney Robert Brewer Jr. said federal law enforcement was doing everything in its power to disrupt and dismantle drug traffickers and their networks. But he added \u201cwe can\u2019t enforce and incarcerate our way out of this supply-demand-addiction cycle.\u201d Brewer said partnerships between state, local and community agencies and groups were critical and urged everyone to work together to \u201chammer home\u201d the message that overdose is preventable and drug addiction is a treatable disease.\nStephan said the District Attorney\u2019s Office prosecutes drug dealers but also protects the public through awareness and outreach through initiatives like the Opioid Project.\nBergmann said people can and do recover from substance abuse disorder. He said the County Health and Human Services Agency provides services and help to more than 111,000 county residents of all ages. Bergmann said the County\u2019s nine programs work with justice partners hospitals, community health centers and other community-based providers to improve, expand and introduce new methods to help those in need.\n\nThe most poignant comments came from Pam Summerfruit, who identified herself simply as \u201cthe parent of an overdose drug victim.\u201d\nSummerfruit said that a week before Thanksgiving in 2016 her 26-year-old son died of a fentanyl overdose after taking an illegally obtained dose of what he thought was Percocet, a pain medication. Summerfruit said her son\u2019s dealer pleaded guilty and was sentenced for manslaughter. But her son is still gone.\n\u201cWe\u2019re left,\u201d Summerfruit said, \u201clike so many other families, to remember our loved ones and to act by spreading the word on this international Overdose Awareness Day that overdose death is preventable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200831.13.17.05"}
