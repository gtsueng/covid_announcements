Wooten, M.D., M.P.H, County public health officer. \u201cEvery one of us has a role and can take action to make a difference in curbing COVID-19.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Tests, Cases and Deaths\nTesting:\n\n6,384 tests were reported to the County since yesterday and 132 or 2% were positive.\nThe 14-day, rolling average percentage of positive tests is 3.0%.\n\nCases:\n\n132 new cases were reported for a San Diego County total of 9,130.\n1,489 or 16.3% of the total cases have required hospitalization.\n421 or 4.6% of all cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nSix new COVID-19 deaths were reported today, bringing the region\u2019s total deaths to 313.
