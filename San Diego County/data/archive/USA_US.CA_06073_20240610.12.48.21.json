Sites were also offered throughout Mexico, and in Mexican consulates in the United States under the \u201cAma Tu Corazon\u201d program.\u00a0\n\u201cIt is incredible to see this effort strengthen each year with more people and more sites getting involved, all having the same goal to save lives,\u201d said Dr. Eric McDonald, County Health and Human Services Agency interim director. \u201cTogether we can take just 5 minutes to protect ourselves and loved ones, we just need more people to know how to Love Your Heart.\u201d\u00a0\nThe County started the\u202fLove Your Heart\u202fcampaign at 15 sites in 2012. The goal was to help people to \u201cknow their numbers\u201d with free blood pressure checks, and to promote education about the dangers of high blood pressure, which is often referred to as \u201cthe silent killer.\u201d\u00a0\nEach year these screenings identify underlying health issues and concerns for some participants who were otherwise unaware. This year, screenings showed 806 people that their blood pressure had reached \u201ccrisis levels,\u201d giving them the opportunity to seek immediate medical help.\u00a0\nAnother 15,863 people\u2014roughly 27%\u2014were alerted their higher-than-normal blood pressure levels categorized them as stage 1 or stage 2 hypertension. Those people were provided information on how to improve their blood pressure with ways to reduce stress, lose weight, eat healthier and exercises they could incorporate into their daily life.\u00a0\nHigh blood pressure is a major risk for strokes and heart disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that heart disease is still the leading cause of death for men, women and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. The CDC says high blood pressure became known as \u201cthe silent killer\u201d because it usually has no warning symptoms and the only way to know if you have it is to\u202fget your blood pressure checked.\u00a0\nSome of the other data the Love Your Heart Report included:\u00a0\n\n48% of blood pressure screenings showed people they had above-normal readings.\u00a0\n2,700 blood-pressure monitors were given out to participants across San Diego County.\u00a0\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240610.12.48.21"}
