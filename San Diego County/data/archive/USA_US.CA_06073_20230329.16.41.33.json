The shelters have so many wonderful dogs, cats, pigs and more\u2014you\u2019d be silly not to check for your next loveable friend.\nCheck out some of the\u00a0available pets on the Animal Services\u00a0website.\nThe Fool Fur Love pet adoption special runs from Saturday, April 1 through Sunday, April 9. Fees include spaying or neutering, a microchip, a rabies shot, updated vaccinations and a one-year dog license for those in the service area. The $20 adoption special is a great break from the normal adoption fee of $75 for a dog and $65 for a cat.\nWalk-in hours are from 1 to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at both the South Shelter, 5821 Sweetwater Road in Bonita, or the North Shelter, 2481 Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad.\nFill out an application online to print or pick one up at the shelter. Applications can also be emailed but it is quicker to go in person.\nIf you cannot adopt, consider\u00a0fostering animals\u00a0or\u00a0volunteering for the shelter. For more information, call (619) 767-2675 or visit the\u00a0Animal Services main website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230329.16.41.33"}
