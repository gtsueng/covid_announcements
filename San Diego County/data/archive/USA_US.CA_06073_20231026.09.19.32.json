Rashes can happen in sensitive areas and can be extremely painful. Often, but not always, people with Mpox experience flu-like symptoms before the rash or sores appear.\u00a0\nDuring last summer\u2019s global outbreak, Mpox affected mostly the LBGTQ+ community, but anyone can get Mpox.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThe Mpox vaccine is widely available, safe and an effective way to lower your risk of getting Mpox or lower the severity of your symptoms if you do get sick,\u201d said County Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. \u201cIt\u2019s important that people at risk are also practicing other safety measures and notifying their partner or partners of any recent illness or rashes.\u201d\u00a0\nThe JYNNEOS vaccine is a two-dose injection that helps prevent against Mpox when given before or shortly after exposure to Mpox. It is available to anyone 16 years and older without parental consent. It is also available for people 16 years of age and younger, with parental consent. Those who have only received one dose of the vaccine should get their second dose for maximum protection 28 days later or as soon as possible if past 28 days. \nIn San Diego County nearly 16,000 people have received at least one dose of the JYNNEOS vaccine. No-cost vaccine including second doses are widely available from healthcare providers and public health clinics. People unsure of where to get a vaccine can call 2-1-1 or make an appointment on MyTurn.ca.gov. \u00a0\nIn addition, people at risk of getting sick with Mpox should consider taking the following safety precautions, especially as seasonal celebrations begin like Halloween and the upcoming holidays:\u00a0\n\nLimit close contact with people who have sores or symptoms or who have been recently exposed to Mpox.\u00a0\nAvoid touching items or materials that someone with Mpox has used.\u00a0\nPractice good hygiene and wash your hands with soap or water.\u00a0\n\nThe County is increasing its case updates to weekly at sandiegocounty.gov/mpox, and via text messages to subscribers. To sign up to receive updates as well as other helpful Mpox information, text COSD MPOX\u202fto 468-311.\u00a0\nCounty Public Health also remains engaged with at-risk communities via regular telebriefings and digital advertising.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231026.09.19.32"}
