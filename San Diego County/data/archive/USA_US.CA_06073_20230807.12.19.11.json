In 2022, County teleworking and alternate schedules avoided 36.5 million miles of commuting.\nThe County also reduced electricity consumption at its buildings by 46%, planted 3,913 trees and conserved more than 1,000 acres of open space.

The County implemented the\u00a0Electric Vehicle Roadmap and updated the Climate Action Plan (CAP).\nThe County is also developing the Regional Decarbonization Framework to plan for a zero-carbon future for the region.\nTo learn more about the CAP Update and get involved, visit our project website and follow along on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230807.12.19.11"}
