Reducing growth and clearing debris around your property can help minimize damage if a gust of wind carries a burning ember into the yard.\nAssess your property\u2019s vulnerability. What would the burning ember land on? Dried leaves in your gutter? The wood pile stacked against your garage? A tall plant that sits under an overgrown tree with overhanging branches on your roof? All of these could lead to fire.\nPlease note that during hot, dry conditions, such as when a red flag warning is issued, people should not attempt to use power tools to clear or reduce brush, as this could spark a fire that can spread to grass and other brush.\nHome- and business-owners can create defensible space by:\n\nCutting grass down to a maximum of 4 inches high.\nRaking up lawn litter such as leaves and pine needles.\nCleaning gutters of leaves and pine needles.\nUsing fire-resistant plants.\nLeaving space between plants.\nCreating \u201cfuel breaks\u201d with gravel walkways, driveways or lawns.\nThinning and pruning shrubs and tree limbs around your home, business.\nRemoving lower tree branches especially any dead ones or ones that overhang or touch your roof.\nMoving flammable items such as wood stacks and propane tanks away from your home or business.\nDisposing of tree trimmings and debris piles quickly.
