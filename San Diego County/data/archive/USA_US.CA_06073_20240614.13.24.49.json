The plan covers four entitlement grant programs and establishes goals for July 1, 2025 through June 30, 2030. Funding covered includes: \u00a0\n\nCommunity Development Block Grant (CDBG): Supports communities by addressing local housing and community development needs.\u00a0\nHOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME): Primarily used to fund the development of affordable housing and rental assistance to lower-income households.\u00a0\nEmergency Solutions Grant (ESG): Provides direct services to persons experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness.\u00a0\nHousing Opportunities for Persons With HIV/AIDS (HOPWA): Provides housing and services to persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families.\u00a0\n\nExamples of projects funded in previous years include affordable housing, home repair and first-time homebuyer programs, building new sidewalks and accessible ramps, the development of neighborhood parks, and supporting services like food assistance.\u00a0\n\u201cKnowing what the community wants and needs is key in our planning process as we look to leverage every federal dollar to elevate our communities and provide needed resources,\u201d David Estrella, director of the County\u2019s Housing and Community Development Services said.\u00a0\nCommunity input and regional data shape the goals and priorities for the five-year plan. The plan outlines the strategy, goals and a summary of actions, activities, and specific federal funding to address identified needs.\u00a0\nFor this five-year plan, the County has planned multi-pronged community outreach. The public can learn more and provide input at Engage San Diego County.\u00a0\nIn addition, 10 in-person events provide the opportunity for in-person feedback and two virtual presentations scheduled between June 17 and July 31.\u00a0\n\nRamona Library\u00a0\nMonday, June 17\u00a0\n4 \u2013 6 p.m.\u00a0\n1275 Main St., Ramona, CA, 92065\u00a0\n\n\nAlpine Library\u00a0\nWednesday, June 26\u00a0\n4 \u2013 6 p.m.\u00a0\n1752 Alpine Blvd, Alpine, CA 91901\u00a0\n\n\nCasa de Oro Library\u00a0\nThursday, June 27\u00a0\n3 \u2013 5 p.m.\u00a0\n9805 Campo Rd Ste 180, Spring Valley, CA 91977\u00a0\n\n\nVirtual Session I\u00a0\nMonday July 1\u00a0\n4 \u2013 6 p.m.\u00a0\n\n\nHousing and Community Development Office\u00a0\nTuesday, July 9\u00a0\n10 a.m. \u2013 12 p.m.\u00a0\n3989 Ruffin Rd., San Diego, 92123\u00a0\n\n\nBorrego Springs Library\u00a0\nWednesday, July 10\u00a0\n3 \u2013 5 p.m.\u00a0\n587 Palm Canyon Dr Ste 125, Borrego Springs, CA 92004\u00a0\n\n\nFallbrook Library\u00a0\nThursday, July 11\u00a0\n4 \u2013 6 p.m.\u00a0\n124 S Mission Rd, Fallbrook, CA 92028\u00a0\n\n\nLakeside Library\u00a0\nWednesday, July 17\u00a0\n3 \u2013 5 p.m.\u00a0\n12428 Woodside Ave, Lakeside, CA 92040\u00a0\n\n\nVirtual Session II\u00a0\nFriday July, 19\u00a0\n10 a.m. \u2013 12 p.m.\u00a0\n\n\nJulian Library\u00a0\nWednesday, July 24\u00a0\n2 \u2013 4 p.m.\u00a0\n1850 Highway 78, Julian, CA 92036\u00a0\n\n\nDescanso Library\u00a0\nThursday, July 25\u00a0\n10:30 a.m. \u2013 12:30 p.m.\u00a0\n9545 River Dr, Descanso, CA 91916\u00a0\n\n\nImperial Beach Library\nWednesday, July 31\u00a0\n4 \u2013 6 p.m.\u00a0\n810 Imperial Beach Blvd, Imperial Beach, CA 91932\u00a0\n\nFor more information and engagement opportunities visit\u202fEngage San Diego\u202fand the\u202fSan Diego County\u202fEngagement Center.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240614.13.24.49"}
