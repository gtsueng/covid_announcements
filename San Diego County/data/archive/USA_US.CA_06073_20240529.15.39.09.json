The team used geo boundaries, like lakes, freeways, mountains and neighborhoods, to create more logical and precise mapping zones.\nThe updated mapping will provide more specific evacuation areas, which will limit unnecessary evacuations. This will also support more efficient repopulations to get people back into their homes sooner.\nGenasys EVAC will be integrated into AlertSanDiego.org and the SD Emergency app. Residents who are already registered do not need to resubscribe or download anything new to get emergency alerts.\nAgencies throughout San Diego County will utilize this technology as part of regional efforts to continue to innovate and capitalize on best practices to keep residents safe and informed during emergencies.\nWith peak fire conditions ahead, regional fire and safety officials gathered Wednesday to promote the Genasys EVAC launch and urge residents to stay safe and prepared.\n\nMake sure you are registered for emergency alerts through AlertSanDiego.org and the SD Emergency app. You\u2019ll get information about evacuations, road closures, emergency shelters and more.\nIn addition to registering for alerts, it is also important to take precautions for increased fire conditions. Here are some tips to reduce the fire risk for your property.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240529.15.39.09"}
