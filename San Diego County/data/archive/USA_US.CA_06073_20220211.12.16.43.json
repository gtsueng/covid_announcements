They held a virtual news conference today to promote the Love Your Heart Week of Action, which runs Feb. 12 through Feb. 20.\nNow in its 11th year, the Love Your Heart campaign uses the period around Valentine\u2019s Day to encourage people to understand their blood pressure numbers and take steps to prevent hypertension.\nHeart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and hypertension is the most common comorbidity in people who have died from COVID-19 in San Diego County. Death certificates for nearly half of the COVID-19 deaths in the region listed hypertension as an underlying condition.\n\u201cThe impact of pre-existing heart disease has really come to the forefront in a very significant way\u00a0during COVID-19,\u201d said Chair Nathan Fletcher, County Board of Supervisors. \u201cWe have seen\u00a0that people who are sickest\u00a0with COVID-19\u00a0tend to have\u00a0underlying health issues, with the most prevalent being high blood pressure.\u201d\nHigh blood pressure is known as the \u201csilent killer\u201d because it may show no symptoms. However, hypertension puts people at an increased risk for heart disease and stroke, two of the top causes of death in the region. More than 4,000 San Diegans die annually from complications of hypertension.\n\u201cThe older you get, the greater your chances of developing high blood pressure,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cRace, physical inactivity, obesity, a family history of hypertension, and smoking also put you at a higher risk of high blood pressure.\u201d\nThis year, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the number of sites offering blood pressure screenings will be more limited than in years past, but free educational and interactive heart health events will be available throughout the region and across the border in Mexico.\nSelect San Diego County Library branches and CVS pharmacy locations are offering onsite blood pressure screenings throughout the Love Your Heart Week of Action. The County and its partners also distributed 1,000 blood pressure monitors to San Diegans in communities where hypertension is most prevalent.\nLove Your Heart aligns with\u00a0Live Well San Diego,\u00a0the County\u2019s vision for healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220211.12.16.43"}
