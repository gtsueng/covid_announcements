The classes were virtual during the pandemic but\u00a0are officially back in public gathering places with a new series serving the community.\u202fVirtual classes will also continue.\u00a0\n\u201cThese classes were designed to empower people living with chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, depression and arthritis and are proven to increase positive health outcomes and reduce healthcare spending,\u201d Kim Gallo, director of AIS said.\u00a0\nFor over 10 years, Keith Donahou has taught many of these classes and is driven by his desire to help others succeed. His class teaches skills like understanding food labels, decision-making and prioritizing.\u202f\u00a0\n\u201cI want to encourage people to enroll to increase your knowledge and change your way of thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cKnowledge is power, and these skills are truly life changing.\u201d\u202f\u00a0\nOver his years of teaching, Donahou had participants drop bad habits like smoking, improve their self-esteem, and gain confidence. \u201cThis brings positivity into your life. Being successful and able to work through problems and decisions is a hugely positive and important part of life,\u201d he said.\u202f\u00a0\nBefore Donahou was a teacher, he was a student. He took the class himself when he was faced with a Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis. He went to his physician and a dietician who both suggested he attend the chronic disease class. Donahou said attending this class changed his life and he wants to pay it forward. \u201cI am working to one day be a Master Trainer so I can train others to lead these classes, to help others like me,\u201d he said.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\nThe classes are six weeks long, offered virtually and in-person and free educational materials are provided. There is a CD that teaches relaxation techniques and other methods to increase decision-making and critical thinking skills that help people better manage their health.\u202f\u00a0\nTo learn more or sign up, visit www.healthierlivingsd.org or call (858) 495-5500.\u202f\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230504.16.05.56"}
