Families stake their lives on these devices if and when a fire breaks out in the middle of the night.\nTypically, people just need to press a button to hear the alarm activate. If it beeps, the battery is still good. Safety experts recommend checking the battery in your smoke alarm monthly and replacing the battery annually.\nSome newer smoke alarms have a special battery that has a 10-year service life that is not replaceable. In this case, continue to test the battery monthly and replace the entire unit after 10 years.\nFor adults who may not be able to evacuate as quickly or who may need assistance, smoke alarms are particularly critical.\nIf you\u2019re a senior without working smoke alarms, the Burn Institute wants to help with its Senior Smoke Alarm Program, which offers people over 62 who own their homes free smoke alarms and installation in San Diego County.
