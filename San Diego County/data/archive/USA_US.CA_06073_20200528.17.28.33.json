However, no activities such as football and volleyball will be permitted. Parking lots will remain closed.\nAll beach communities agreed to ease this restriction starting June 2, but cities can decide if they want to proceed later and how the guideline is going to be enforced.\nPlasma from Recovered COVID-19 Cases Needed\nThe San Diego Blood Bank is partnering with the County to encourage San Diegans who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate plasma. It could help treat people who are hospitalized or seriously ill from the novel virus.\nWhile currently there is no vaccine or proven treatment for COVID-19, what\u2019s known as convalescent plasma may help patients fighting the virus because the plasma has antibodies against it. The effort supports the County\u2019s T3 Strategy of test, trace and treat.\n\u201cThis partnership helps us to achieve one of the indicators at the federal level for treatment of COVID-19,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited about this partnership.\u201d\nAny of the more than 7,000 people who tested positive for COVID-19 and have recovered could donate plasma.\nTo donate convalescent plasma, people must also meet the regular screening criteria for blood donation. Donor information will be kept confidential and used for screening purposes only.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite simple, but tremendously impactful,\u201d said David Wellis, chief executive officer of the San Diego Blood Bank.\nWellis said 377 doses of convalescent plasma have been distributed across Southern California, especially San Diego County, but more is needed.\n\u201cThe current hospital demand for (COVID-19 convalescent plasma) is great, but we\u2019re not meeting the demand. And that sets the stage for this very innovative partnership,\u201d Wellis said.\nAnyone Can Get Tested for COVID-19\nCOVID-19 testing is now more widely available in the region. Testing options include calling your doctor or medical provider to schedule an appointment, signing up on the\u00a0state website, or calling 2-1-1.\n\u201cGiven the testing priorities provided at the federal, state and local level, anyone who wants a test can get it,\u201d Wooten said.\nCounty public health nurse administers a COVID-19 test.\nThe County is opening additional COVID-19 testing sites for people who are not showing symptoms of the virus. A doctor\u2019s referral is not required, but an appointment is necessary. To make an appointment, you should call 2-1-1.\nPeople who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 are encouraged to contact their health care provider and arrange for testing.
