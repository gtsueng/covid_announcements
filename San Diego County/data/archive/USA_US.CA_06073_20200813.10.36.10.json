We may have the next big love of your life waiting for you at one of our animal shelters. The County Department of Animal Services is participating in this year\u2019s monthlong Clear the Shelters adoption event being done online to prevent potential spread of coronavirus.\n\nThe event is sponsored by NBC and Telemundo with the goal of finding homes for as many pets as possible through media exposure and promotions. Usually the event lasts only a few days but it runs through Aug. 31 this year. Last year, the County adopted out 119 pets for the event.\n\nCounty shelters are offering all pets that have been in our care longer than 30 days for a discounted adoption fee of just $5.\nAnimal personalities and energy run the gamut. If you are looking for a pal to go on long walks or a run with or perhaps a couch cuddlebug, you will likely find them in one of our animals.\nTo see the available dogs, cats and others including pigs, a turtle, a love bird and a rabbit who could be your faithful friend for life, please visit the adoptions page and fill out an online application that includes their ID number. Due to public health safety precautions, adoptions are by appointment only.\nCurrently, about 46\u00a0pets are available\u00a0at the\u00a0County\u2019s\u202ftwo\u202fanimal care facilities\u202flocated in Bonita and Carlsbad. All the adopted animals will be spayed or neutered, and microchipped before they go home. Vaccinations will also be up to date on dogs and cats.\n\nNormal adoption fees are:\u00a0kittens under 6 months old,\u00a0$75;\u00a0cats,\u00a0$65;\u00a0puppies under 6 months,\u00a0$100; and dogs,\u00a0$75.\nFor more information about County Animal Services, visit\u202fsddac.com\u202for call (619) 767-2675.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200813.10.36.10"}
