Black infants are also 50 percent more likely to be born premature.\u00a0\nIn California, Black women are more than three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes due to bias and racism than White women.\u00a0\nThe County\u2019s Perinatal Equity Initiative which started in 2018 is an expansion of its Black Infant Health program which works to provide culturally appropriate support services and resources to African-American families.\u00a0\nFunding from the Perinatal Equity Initiative has been used for a fatherhood program for new and expectant dads to support their partners, to provide implicit bias training for hundreds of health care professionals and for the Black Legacy Now public awareness campaign.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA community advisory board is also active and includes 200 community members who give feedback and direction on program activities.\u00a0\u00a0\nVisit www.blacklegacynowsd.com to find resources for current and future parents, get the facts, know your rights and commit to action by advocating for Black women, babies and families in San Diego.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240924.17.48.34"}
