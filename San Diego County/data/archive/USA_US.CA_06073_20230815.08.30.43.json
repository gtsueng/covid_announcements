The counting of ballots does not end election night.\nWhat\u2019s left to count?\nMail ballots. The Registrar\u2019s office mailed nearly 400,000 ballots for this election and a portion of those were dropped off at vote centers, official ballot drop boxes or picked up by the U.S. Postal Service on Election Day. Mail ballots sent right before or on Aug. 15 have seven days to arrive if postmarked by Election Day.\nThen there are provisional ballots. People who missed the July 31 registration deadline may conditionally register and vote provisionally in person up to and on Election Day.\nOnce their voter registration is processed and the Registrar\u2019s office confirms the voter did not vote elsewhere in the district, the voter registration becomes active and the provisional ballot is counted.\nAfter election night, the next release of unofficial results is scheduled to be posted by 5 p.m. on Aug. 17. Additional updates will occur at the discretion of the Registrar of Voters.\nHowever, the results must be certified by Sept. 14. For this special election, certification may occur on an earlier date. All updates will be posted on sdvote.com with the final certified results posted by Sept. 14.\nFor more information, visit sdvote.com or call (858) 565-5800.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230815.08.30.43"}
