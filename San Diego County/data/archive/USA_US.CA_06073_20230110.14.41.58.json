She sees future investments in public transit opportunities, parks and open spaces to help create positive environmental and economic impacts to our region.\n\u201cWe have a lot of work ahead of us, and that is why I invite everyone who is listening or watching to join us and participate in these proceedings. This is your county, these are your chambers, and I want you to know that when you come before this board, I hear you,\u201d said Chair Vargas. \u201cI look forward to continuing to work with our veterans and our community organizations, our seniors, our small businesses, our faith communities, our labor unions and all who care deeply about building a better county for all.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230110.14.41.58"}
