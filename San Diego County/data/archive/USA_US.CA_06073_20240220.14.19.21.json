For more information, visit the FDA site.\nThe County\u2019s Department of Environmental Health & Quality has reached out to local retailers listed in the recall to determine if they\u2019ve removed the product from shelves.\nCustomers who have purchased these Rizo-L\u00f3pez Foods items should not eat them. The products should be thrown away or returned to the store.\nListeria monocytogenes is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems.\nAlthough healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.\nThe FDA recommends that anyone who purchased or received any recalled products to use extra vigilance in cleaning and sanitizing any surfaces and containers that may have come in contact with these products to reduce the risk of cross-contamination.\nListeria monocytogenes\u202fcan survive in refrigerated temperatures and can easily spread to other foods and surfaces.\nIf you have eaten these items and are ill, consult a medical professional.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240220.14.19.21"}
