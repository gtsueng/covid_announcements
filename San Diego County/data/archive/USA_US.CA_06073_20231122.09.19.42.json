Fostering is easy. Food, supplies and veterinary care are provided. You just provide the love, attention and temporary shelter.\nCounty shelter staff and volunteers do their best to provide care and comfort to stray or relinquished animals, but there is no substitute for a home, even a temporary one.\nMany of the animals that come into County shelters were previously in homes, so being in a shelter can be stressful for them, especially over time.\nA foster opportunity gives homeless animals a break from an animal shelter and teaches them what it\u2019s like to be in a home again.\nThe County\u2019s shelters in Bonita and Carlsbad have twice as many animals as usual in their care right now, including an unusually high number of medium and large dogs.
