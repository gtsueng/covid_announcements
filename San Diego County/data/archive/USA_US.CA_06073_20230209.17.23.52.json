Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. \u201cThe coronavirus is still circulating in our community and can be dangerous and even fatal for some who contract it. The best way to prevent getting seriously ill is to get current with your COVID-19 vaccinations, including your bivalent booster.\u201d\nThe County\u2019s Board of Supervisors accepted a COVID-19 update this week stating the County\u2019s nearly 3-year-old coronavirus local and health emergencies will end Feb. 28, matching the state of California\u2019s ending date.\nThe update also stated the County will continue to provide all the services needed to protect the public and respond to the continuing pandemic including surveillance,\u00a0testing, tracing,\u00a0treatment,\u00a0vaccinations\u00a0and\u00a0public engagement.\nCOVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are currently declining in San Diego County.\nBoth COVID-19\u00a0vaccinations\u00a0and\u00a0treatment\u00a0remain widely available throughout San Diego County.

The\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u00a0and\u00a0California Department of Public Health\u00a0(CDPH) recommend a bivalent booster for everyone six months of age and older.\u00a0Previous CDC studies have reported that\u00a0people who have not been vaccinated run much higher risks of dying from COVID-19\u00a0than those who have been vaccinated.\nPreventive Measures\u202f\u00a0\u00a0\nIn addition to vaccination and staying home when ill, San Diegans can take\u00a0other precautions\u00a0to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu.
