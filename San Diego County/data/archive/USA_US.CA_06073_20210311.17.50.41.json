This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.\nOf those vaccinated to date, nearly 386,000 County residents, or 14.4% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nOverall, more than 678,000 County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That\u2019s 25.2% of those eligible.\nThose receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s vaccination dashboard. For details on groups currently eligible and vaccination opportunities, visit\u00a0www.vaccinationsuperstation.com.\n\nA COVID-19 vaccination is administered at the Grossmont Center Vaccination Super Station.\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 8.8 cases per 100,000 residents (as of March 9) and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 3.3%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier. While the testing positivity rate for the County qualifies it for Tier 3, the state uses the most restrictive metric \u2013 in this case the adjusted case rate \u2013 and assigns counties to that tier. Therefore, the County remains in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 4.5% and is in the Orange Tier or Tier 3. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance to a less restrictive tier.\nThe California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, March. 16.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nTwo new community outbreaks were confirmed March 10: one in a business setting and one in a grocery setting.\nIn the past seven days (March 4 through March 10), 13 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n16,204 tests were reported to the County on March 10, and the percentage of new positive cases was 3%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 3.1%. Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 12,977.\n\nCases, Hospitalizations and ICU Admissions:\n\n430 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County on March 10. The region\u2019s total is now 264,527.\n13,306 or 5% of all cases have required hospitalization.\n1,618 or 0.6% of all cases and 12.2% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nNine new COVID-19 deaths were reported March 10. The region\u2019s total is 3,422.\nEight men and one woman died between Feb. 23 and March 9.\nOf the nine deaths reported March 10, two people who died were 80 years or older, three were in their 70s, three were in their 60 and one was in their 50s.\nEight had underlying medical conditions and one did not.\n\nMore Information:\nThe more detailed data summaries found on the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0are updated around 5 p.m. daily.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210311.17.50.41"}
