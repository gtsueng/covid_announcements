The 65 deaths reported today surpass the previous single-day record of 62 deaths reported on New Year\u2019s Eve.\nHealth officials are attributing the spike in deaths to holiday gatherings.\n\u201cThe majority of the COVID-19 deaths we are reporting today occurred in the past two weeks, which suggests that illness onset for the individuals who passed away coincided with the winter holidays, said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H.

County health officials urge San Diegans to:\n\nWash your hands\nWear a mask\nKeep your distance from others and leave your household only for essential activities\nIf you\u2019re sick, get tested, and then stay home and isolate yourself\nConsider getting vaccinated once you are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nMore information about the vaccine can be found at\u00a0coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine\nICU Capacity and Stay Home Order:\n\nThe current intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability for the Southern California region is 0.0% and will be updated by the state daily.\nThe\u00a0Regional Stay Home Order\u00a0is in effect and prohibits gatherings of any size with people from other households and adds restrictions for multiple sectors.\nThe order will last until the region\u2019s ICU availability meets or exceeds 15%.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nSeven new community outbreaks were confirmed on Jan. 19: four in business settings, one in a daycare/preschool/childcare setting, one in a distribution warehouse setting and one in a faith-based agency setting.\nIn the past seven days (Jan. 13 through Jan. 19), 47 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n18,359 tests were reported to the County on Jan. 19, and the percentage of new positive cases was 9%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 11.8%.
