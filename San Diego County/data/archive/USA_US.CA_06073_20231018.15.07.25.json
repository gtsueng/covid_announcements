But it also wants to address any emerging issues or needs.\nThe Department of Public Works will host meetings involving community infrastructure projects like County-maintained roads, bridges, storm drains, sidewalks and more.\nThese are typically in the unincorporated areas, outside of the region\u2019s 18 cities.\nA separate meeting will address the County\u2019s overall Capital Plan which includes the facilities and infrastructure located throughout the region \u2013 the unincorporated areas and the 18 cities.\nThey involve things like the Live Well centers, libraries, County administration buildings, recreation centers, Sheriff\u2019s stations and the purchase of land to build parks.\nYou can find out what\u2019s already underway in your community and give your input on what may be needed in the future.\nThe next Public Works meeting takes place Thursday, Oct. 19 at the Valley Center Library in the North County.\nYou\u2019re also invited to a virtual session on Public Works projects on Wednesday, Nov. 1. Both meetings will run from 6 to 7:30 p.m.\nA virtual workshop on the Capital Plan projects is scheduled from 6 to 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 26.\nFor more information about the plans that direct how we build and maintain those places that serve you, visit Engage San Diego County and click on County Facilities and Infrastructure.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231018.15.07.25"}
