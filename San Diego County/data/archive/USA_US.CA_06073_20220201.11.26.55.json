And Alora is a significant step in this effort.\u201d\nThe four, 3-story walk-up buildings will have laundry rooms, a pool, community room, tot lots and 171 parking spaces. Alora is expected to open in summer 2023.\n\nAlora\u2019s funding includes $6.25 million from the County\u2019s Innovative Housing Trust Fund and funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The development will remain affordable in the community of San Marcos for 99 years, ensuring that the residents have an opportunity for safe affordable housing.\nThe Innovative Housing Trust Fund was established by the County to provide gap financing for developments that create or preserve affordable housing. To date, the $50 million invested in the fund has leveraged $567 million in other public and private funds to create and preserve 1,397 permanent affordable housing units within 20 developments in 15 communities throughout San Diego County. In Aug. 2021, the Board of Supervisors increased funding by $20 million for a total of $70 million.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220201.11.26.55"}
