The first was the County\u2019s Climate Action Plan Update. The second was the regionwide decarbonization plan, called a Regional Decarbonization Framework, the Board voted to pursue in January to move the San Diego region toward zero carbon by 2035.\nCounty staff said both plans would seek to reduce greenhouse gas and carbon emissions, focusing on both equity and zero-carbon goals, but they differ in scope and approval process.\nThe County\u2019s Climate Action Plan Update will be designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated by anticipated future development in unincorporated San Diego County communities \u2014 the 772,000 acres over which the County has land-use authority \u2014 and from County operations. That plan can be approved by the County Board of Supervisors alone.\nIn contrast, the Regional Decarbonization Framework will affect the entire region, not just the unincorporated areas. That plan would require the County to work with, and have the participation of, other public agencies including cities, transportation agencies and school districts.\nThe County is working with the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy and the Energy Policy Initiatives Center at the University of San Diego School of Law to create a framework for its proposed regional zero-carbon plan. County staff said they\u2019re also studying the best emissions reduction plans from across the nation. Staff members said Wednesday they expect to complete a draft framework for the regional effort in November and bring it to the Board for consideration in February.\nCreating the Climate Action Plan\u00a0 Update\nTo prepare the Climate Action Plan Update, County staff is collecting emissions data from five sectors throughout 2019 to establish a baseline from which reduction goals can be set and progress measured. The goal is to reach net-zero emissions by 2035-2045.\nCounty Planning & Development Services staff have already started working on several aspects of the Climate Action Plan Update, processing emissions data to create the inventory, reviewing emissions-reduction measures and preparing an environmental study.\nThe department is also preparing to hold several more public workshops to gather community feedback, starting July 28. County staff estimate they will complete a draft plan next year. They expect to bring a completed Climate Action Plan and Supplemental Environmental Impact Report to the Board for consideration in winter 2022.\nThe County is currently continuing to implement many of the 26 greenhouse gas reduction measures that were in the County\u2019s 2018 Climate Action Plan. The Board of Supervisors rescinded that plan in September 2020 after deciding not to further appeal a court ruling. That ruling and legal challenge, however, took no issue with the measures, which decreased carbon dioxide emissions by 160,743 metric tons, exceeding the County\u2019s 2020 goal by 22%.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210715.13.21.37"}
