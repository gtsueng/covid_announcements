You can access the map from a link on\u00a0 www.vaccinationsuperstationsd.com.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it easier for people to make an appointment and get vaccinated when it\u2019s their turn,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThe vaccine is safe and effective and it\u2019s the best tool we have to slow the pandemic.\u201d\nCounty to Open Vaccination Clinic in San Marcos\nStarting Jan. 31, a new COVID-19 vaccination super station will be up and running on the California State University San Marcos campus.\nThe new pedestrian site will be vaccinating people, with appointments, from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Sunday through Thursday at the Sports Center and Clarke Field House, located at 333 South Twin Oaks Valley Road in San Marcos. \u00a0Free parking will be available in Parking Structure 1 on levels 2 and 3 and disabled parking in Lot L next to the Sports Center,\nThe County-run site is a collaboration between the County and CSU San Marcos, with staff support from Palomar Health, UC San Diego Health and Tri-City Medical Center. It will offer about 1,000 doses daily depending on vaccine availability but can ramp up to vaccinate 5,000 people daily when more vaccine is available. Appointments are required and can be scheduled at www.vaccinationsuperstationsd.com. Appointments for this site will become available Saturday afternoon.\nIn Borrego Springs this weekend, a CAL FIRE team as part of \u201cOperation Collaboration\u201d will provide 250 COVID-19 doses both Saturday and Sunday. Appointments are necessary.\nOperation Collaboration is a consortium of local fire agencies using County vaccine. CAL FIRE and other groups will also be going to other communities soon, especially to vaccinate people in nursing and long-term care homes.\nAll County clinics are vaccinating people in Phase 1A and people 65 years and older in Phase 1B and require appointments, which can be made at\u00a0vaccinationsuperstationsd.com. People 75 and older who don\u2019t have access to a computer or Internet can call 2-1-1 for assistance in scheduling an appointment.\nSan Diegans without transportation can use the Metropolitan Transit System to travel to a vaccination site for free by showing proof of their appointment.\nVaccination appointments fill up quickly, so County health officials are urging San Diegans to wait their turn and get vaccinated when more doses become available.\n\u201cBe patient. Your turn will come,\u201d Wooten said.\nAn older man gets vaccinated against COVID-19 at the vaccination super station in Chula Vista.\nThe County plans to open two more\u00a0vaccination super stations\u00a0in East and North County in February.\nSome doctors, pharmacists and other health care providers may administer vaccinations to those 65 and older, if they have doses available.\nThrough Jan. 27, about 486,000 doses have been shipped to the region and more than 269,000 have been entered into the immunization data base as having been administered. More information on vaccine distribution can be found on the County vaccination dashboard.\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 49.6 cases per 100,000 residents and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.\nThe testing positivity percentage is 12.6%, placing the County in Tier 1 or the Purple Tier.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 16.7% and it\u2019s in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.
