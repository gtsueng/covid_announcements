And a lot of resources will come into this community as a result of the new library, because it will be bigger and better.\u201d\nCounty officials say construction is expected to start in spring 2021 and be completed in summer 2022.\nThe County\u2019s Board of Supervisors voted to buy the land to build the new library in September 2017, when Jacob called it a project \u201cnear and dear to me and many folks in Lakeside.\u201d\nThe new $19 million facility will be a be a solar-powered \u201czero net-energy building,\u201d with a 2,000-square-foot community room that can seat 150 people. The community room alone is a little less than one-half the size of the current 5,000-square-foot Lakeside library that was built in 1962. The new library will be built just a few blocks away from the current branch on Woodside Road near Channel Road.\nIn addition to the community room, the new library will include five study rooms, a conference room, a patio, a Friends of the Library bookstore and public art. It will also feature the latest in library technology, including automated book returns, a laptop kiosk, an audio-visual system and digital signage.\nCounty Library Director Migell Acosta said the community room will be able to be used for numerous types of events: cultural, musical, dance, educational and lectures.\nFor more information about the County library, go to the Library\u2019s\u00a0webpage.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20201125.11.03.13"}
