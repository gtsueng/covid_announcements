Edgemoor provides long-term skilled nursing care for individuals with complex medical needs who require specialized interventions\u00a0from highly trained staff.\nThe new services will support Edgemoor residents in receiving the specialty psychiatric care they need, in close proximity to where they live. The addition will also improve access to care for other adults in need of acute psychiatric services in East County.\nOnce construction is completed, the new acute psychiatric unit is expected to connect people to community-based care, diverting them from unnecessary hospitalization.\nYouth Mental Health\nThe second grant will make significant investments into suicide prevention programs for young people. The grant will allow the County to enhance the existing Creating Opportunities in Preventing and Eliminating Suicide, or COPES program.\nCOPES is a suicide prevention and mental health wellness education program that makes suicide prevention resources and information more accessible for school staff, students, and families.\nTuesday\u2019s Board action will allow schools to hire additional mental health personnel, provide professional development for school staff, and support other strategies that respond to the mental health needs of children and youth.\n\u201cThe funding from these grants will support the department in advancing efforts to transform the behavioral health continuum of care by enhancing services for some of the most vulnerable populations in our region,\u201d said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. \u201cThey are important parts of our continuing work to expand and normalize the delivery of behavioral health care in our region.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220816.16.51.43"}
