If the rate of infection for the region does not fall below 100, the period of restrictions could be extended unless the state issues new guidance.\nMore Young People Getting Infected\nIn recent weeks, the percentage of cases in people between 20 and 39 years old has been increasing compared to other age groups. Currently, they represent about 50% of the cases being reported.\n\u201cThe surge in cases is occurring in these age groups because they are less likely to wear a face covering and maintain physical distance,\u201d Wooten said.\nWhen outside the home, San Diegans should do the following to protect themselves and others:\n\nPractice good hand hygiene and sanitation\nKeep six feet apart\nWear a face covering\nAvoid crowded places\nStay home if they are sick\n\nCOVID-19 Triggers, Tests, Cases and Deaths\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks and Other Triggers:\n\nOne new outbreak was reported July 5, in a restaurant/bar.\nIn the past seven days, 21 community setting outbreaks were identified.\nThe number of new outbreaks in community settings is above the trigger of seven in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.\nThe County also reached the Case Investigation trigger because only 57% of investigations were initiated within 24 hours of notification over a 7-day period. The percentage should be at least 71%.\n\nTesting:\n\n7,667 tests were reported to the County July 5 and 4% were positive new cases.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests is 5.4%.\nThe 7-day daily average of tests is 7,730.\n\nCases:\n\n274 were reported July 5 in San Diego County for a total of 17,000.\n1,912 or 11.2% of cases have required hospitalization.\n516 or 3% of all cases and 27% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nNo COVID-19 deaths were reported July 5, and the region\u2019s total remains at 387.\n\nMore COVID-19 Information\nMore information on COVID-19 and detailed data summaries can be found at the County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200706.18.50.50"}
