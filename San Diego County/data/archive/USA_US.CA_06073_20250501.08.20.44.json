The County reduced staffing through attrition, eliminating some vacant positions and streamlining some operations.\nThe budget continues to invest in housing, homeless solutions and behavioral health.\nIt leverages new funding opportunities to invest more than $100 million in behavioral health resources, supporting long-term recovery through community-based treatment, prevention and alternatives to jail and emergency rooms.\nAnd it helps more than 1 million San Diegans who need access to safety net programs that are critical to ensuring people and families have the food and support they need, programs such as CalWORKs, Medi-Cal and CalFresh.\nIt increases investments in public safety, with additional funding to provide care for youth and adults in our custody, deploy more ambulances and to support programs such as Alternatives to Incarceration and job training, mental health and substance use disorder treatment.\u00a0It also establishes a Community Engagement Unit in the Office of Emergency Services.\nThe budget shows the County\u2019s commitment to environmental sustainability. And the current recommended budget protects current hours and locations at parks and libraries.\nThe County budget touches nearly everyone in the region in some way and is shaped by public input throughout the year.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegionally, County government provides services like:\u00a0\n\nSocial services and health programs\nCriminal prosecution, detention facilities and emergency preparedness\nFood and restaurant inspections, and beach and bay water monitoring\nElections\n\nIn the unincorporated area, County government provides things a city government would typically do like:\n\nLaw enforcement and fire protection\nRoads, parks and libraries\nBuilding permits\nAnimal shelters and protection\n\nSome cities also contract with the County to provide services.\nNearly half of the County\u2019s funding comes from the state and federal government but that money must be used for certain programs. The rest comes from property taxes, fees for services and other sources.\nYou can learn more about the recommended plan by reviewing an executive summary\u00a0or the full recommended budget plan.\nYou can also give your feedback in person and online. An in-person open house is scheduled for 5 p.m. on Thursday, May 22 at the County Operations Center. A virtual open house will take place at 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, May 28.
