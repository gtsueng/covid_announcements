The assessment helps address the harms caused by cannabis criminalization. In June 2023, the County received $350,000 in grants from the State to help those that apply.\nSince the completion of the assessment and grant award, the Office of Equity and Racial Justice worked with County Counsel to develop the program. People who qualify for the program must meet one of the two criteria tiers:\n\nTier A focuses on people incarcerated for a San Diego cannabis-related crime prior to the passing of Proposition 64 (Control, Regulate and Tax Act \u2013 Adult Use of Marijuana)\nTier B focuses on people that have been convicted or arrested for a San Diego cannabis-related crime along with a low-income component.\n\nOnce approved, people who qualify will have an opportunity to receive a permit for sale, distribution or cultivation and receive help with any of the below listed elements:\n\nBusiness and Technical Assistance\nOne-on-One Assistance\nLegal Services\nGrants directly to social equity applicants\nRecord Expungement\n\n\u201cThis is a significant first step for our County to address harms that were done to our Community by the County and other government agencies. Although we are excited, we acknowledge that we can and need to do so much more,\u201d said Andrew Strong, Director of the Office of Equity and Racial Justice.\nCounty officials say the program will provide sustainable opportunities for growth by providing support and resources for those who were most harmed by the War on Drugs.\n\u201cI am proud that this program will focus on equity, access, and business opportunities to help rectify the injustices against people of color caused by the many years of failed policies like the War on Drugs,\u201d said Chairwoman Nora Vargas.\nA nine-member group, one appointed by each County supervisor and four more to apply through application process, will assist on shaping the program and provide an annual report back to the Board.\nVisit our new\u202fEngage San Diego County\u202fplatform\u00a0to learn more about the development of the Cannabis Program.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240501.17.44.41"}
