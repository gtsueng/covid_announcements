The work is designed to help people secure more permanent housing and connect them with much-needed services while also cleaning up the riverbed.\nLate last year, the State made $240 million in Encampment Resolution Fund grants available to local jurisdictions to help resolve encampments and get people into housing and services. The County applied for and secured that funding in collaboration with the City of San Diego, City of Santee and California Department of Transportation.\nThe money, awarded to the County\u2019s Department of Homeless Solutions & Equitable Communities, will expand previous efforts to help the estimated 300 people experiencing homelessness who are living along the riverbed.\n\u201cOur team was excited to get out there yesterday and start this work,\u201d said Barbara Jim\u00e9nez, County Community Operations Officer. \u201cIn collaboration with our partners at the City of San Diego, City of Santee and Caltrans we\u2019ll be able to improve the lives of community members now living unhoused in the riverbed.\u201d\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230728.08.15.12"}
