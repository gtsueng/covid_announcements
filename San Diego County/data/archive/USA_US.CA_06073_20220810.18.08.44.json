Those included a team of local organizations, community partners and other county departments who worked on the project and that provide outreach in the surrounding area.\nThis is the first Safe Parking program opened by the County. It includes hygiene facilities, 24/7 security, two hot meals for overnight guests and access to local YMCA facilities.\n\u201cI am thankful to my Board colleagues for supporting my \u2018Compassionate Emergency Solutions\u2019 board letter that made this Safe Parking a reality in East County,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThis safe parking lot is an incredibly important step in the right direction toward us solving this homelessness crisis \u2013 and creating a safer community.\u201d\nThe 17-space site is located on North Magnolia Avenue in El Cajon in an unincorporated area of San Diego County. Parking spaces are assigned by referral only through the County\u2019s Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities outreach teams. The lot opens nightly at 5:30 p.m. Guests must exit each morning by 7:00 am.\nDreams for Change, a local homeless service provider, has been contracted by the county to run the program. Its case managers will assist customers with housing navigation and connect them to resources to help them transition to a more permanent housing solution.\n\u201cThis is just one example of the County\u2019s commitment to homelessness, behavioral health and substance use,\u201d said Nick Macchione, Director of the County\u2019s Health and Human Services Agency. \u201cMore plans are underway in East County for Mobile Crisis Response Teams and a new East County Crisis Stabilization Unit.\u201d\nEarlier this year, the Magnolia Avenue site was part of a large homeless encampment that spread below the overpass and spilled into the street.\nCounty homeless outreach teams walked the area for two months, offering support and direct services to everyone living here. Those teams issued EBT cards, distributed 219 hygiene and 178 Narcan kits, provided 48 vaccines and connected 103 individuals to shelter and housing.\n\u201cThis project has been so rewarding, and a tremendous, shared learning experience to get to where we are today,\u201d said Barbara Jim\u00e9nez, Community Operations Officer for the County Department of Homeless Solutions & Equitable Communities. \u201cIt is a testament to how collaboration can lead to successful results in a short amount of time and will be a model for future projects.\u201d\nIf you come in contact with someone in need of a referral to this new Safe Parking facility, please call (619) 980-4168 or email HSEC-OHS.HHSA@sdcounty.ca.gov.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220810.18.08.44"}
