This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.\nOf those vaccinated to date, more than 821,000 County residents, or 30.6% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nOverall, more than 1.29 million County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That\u2019s 48.1% of those eligible.\nThe goal is to fully vaccinate\u00a075% of San Diego County residents 16 and older or 2,017,011 people. To date, 64.1% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 40.7% are fully vaccinated.\nThose who received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine,\u00a0which is currently on hold\u00a0in the County due to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration, are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s\u00a0vaccination dashboard. For vaccination opportunities, visit\u00a0www.vaccinationsuperstation.com.\n\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 6.0 cases per 100,000 residents (as of April 13).\nThe County remains in the Orange Tier or Tier 3 under the state\u2019s new guidance. The California Department of Public Health recently advised that unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as low rate of vaccine uptake, a county will only move to a more restrictive tier if hospitalizations are increasing significantly among vulnerable individuals, especially among vaccinated individuals, and both testing positivity and adjusted case rates show a concerning increase in transmission. This is currently not the case in the region.\nCurrently, the testing positivity percentage is 2.5%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 3.0% and is also in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.\nCDPH assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, April 20.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nNo new community outbreaks were confirmed April 18.\nFive new community outbreaks were confirmed April 17, one in a business setting, one in an emergency services setting, one in a faith-based agency setting, one in a restaurant/bar setting and one in a retail setting.\nTwo new community outbreaks were confirmed April 16, one in a daycare/preschool/childcare setting and one in a faith-based agency setting.\nIn the past seven days (April 12 through April 18), 21 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n6,982 tests were reported to the County on April 18, and the percentage of new positive cases was 2%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 1.8%. Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 12,877.\n\nCases, Hospitalizations and ICU Admissions:\n\n152 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County on April 18. The region\u2019s total is now 275,112.\n15,144 or 5.5% of all cases have required hospitalization.\n1,676 or 0.6% of all cases and 11.1% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nNo new COVID-19 deaths were reported April 18. The region\u2019s total is 3,674.\nNo additional deaths were reported on April 17.\nTwelve additional deaths were reported on April 16.\nSeven of these deaths occurred in December and five in April. The deaths from December were just added to the list after a rigorous review of death certificates that were incorrect or incomplete and required the analysis of the patients\u2019 medical records to determine if they were COVID-19 deaths.\nFive women and seven men died between Dec. 10, 2020 and April 14, 2021.\nOf the people whose deaths were reported on Saturday, four were 80 years of age or older, four were in their 70s, two were in their 60s and two were in their 50s.\nEleven had underlying medical conditions and one did not.\n\nMore Information:\nThe more detailed data summaries found on the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0are updated around 5 p.m. daily.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210419.17.50.23"}
