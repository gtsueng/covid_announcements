The County Health and Human Services Agency is urging parents to protect their children, and themselves, by getting vaccinated with the new booster.\nThe Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has expanded the emergency use of the updated Pfizer and Moderna bivalent booster vaccines for children as young as six months. The FDA previously expanded availability to include 5- to 11-year-olds in October. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and California Department of Public Health quickly recommended vaccinations for young children after the FDA approval.\n\u201cWe can now provide additional protection for children as young as six months of age from COVID-19,\u201d said County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H.\u00a0 \u201cThis is especially important with the high incidence of COVID-19 in our community. Please take advantage and have your children vaccinated to protect them and the rest of your family.\u201d\nCounty residents continue to deal with a triple threat of respiratory diseases this winter season, from COVID-19 to the flu to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Public Health officials still strongly urge people to get vaccinated for both COVID-19 and the flu.\nThe bivalent COVID-19 booster and flu vaccinations are separate shots, but they can be given at the same visit. They effectively decrease the chances of getting infected, being hospitalized, or dying from the separate viruses that each vaccine targets. Boosters are available through healthcare providers and at participating pharmacies. Parents can visit the state\u2019s My Turn website to schedule an appointment.\nCounty of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency began offering boosters for children as early as six months age today. Booster dose availability is listed on the County\u2019s COVID-19 vaccinations schedule webpage.\nThe updated boosters were designed to protect individuals from the worst outcomes of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death. Everyone six months of age and older who has had their primary vaccination series is eligible to get the updated booster two months following any COVID vaccine or booster dose.\nCounty officials also recommend wearing a mask if you are able, particularly during indoor public gatherings, to protect yourself and those around you.\nIn addition to vaccination and masking, San Diegans can take a number of other precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include:\n\nCleaning hands thoroughly and often;\nStaying away from sick people;\nStaying home and avoiding contact with others when sick;\nHome testing when exposed or when ill; Regularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces.\n\nFederal Government Makes Free At-home Tests Available Again:\nThe White House has moved to make free at-home COVID-19 tests available again through the winter for a limited time. Households can order one pack of four free tests through the U.S. Postal Service. \u00a0For more information about testing, go to the County of San Diego COVID-19 testing webpage.\nCOVID-19 Vaccination Progress:\n\nClose to 2.69 million or 80.4% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.\nBivalent boosters administered: 474,245 or 19% of 2,494,254 eligible San Diegans.\nMore vaccination information can be found at\u202fcoronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.\u00a0\n\nCOVID-19 Deaths:\n\n24 additional deaths were reported since the last report on Dec. 8, 2022.
