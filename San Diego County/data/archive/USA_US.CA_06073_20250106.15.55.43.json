She said none of it had been easy, but the Board is going to continue to make progress.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a researcher, a rabble-rouser, an educator, an attorney, an organizer, an author \u2013 and after gathering a lot of empirical data during my first term, I can say with confidence, that being a County supervisor is one of the most rewarding, challenging, sometimes very surprising, and always fulfilling jobs that I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Supervisor Lawson-Remer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so worth it. Because together, we\u2019ve been creating the change you sent me here to accomplish.\u201d\nBefore his election as a County Supervisor, Joel Anderson had served East County in various roles including the State Assembly and the State Senate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor and a privilege to represent my district and I love my job\u2026,\u201d said Supervisor Joel Anderson. \u201cThey\u2019ve trusted me for 22 years to represent them and it\u2019s an incredible privilege, and I\u2019m so delighted to do it for another four years.\u201d\nChairwoman Nora Vargas also won a second term, but recently announced she is ending her tenure as supervisor for District 1. Her first term concluded Monday at noon.\nThe County will determine the process to fill the position in accordance with San Diego County Charter, Section 401.4 and Board Policy A-39, which states the Board of Supervisors must meet within seven business days of the vacancy to determine the method to fill the vacancy from one of three options: fill the vacancy by appointment, fill the vacancy by appointment until a special election, or call a special election. The Board of Supervisors will hold a special meeting Tuesday, Jan. 14 at 12 p.m.\nThe County is committed to serving the residents of District 1 and all of those in the region during this transition to ensure they have the support and services they need.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250106.15.55.43"}
