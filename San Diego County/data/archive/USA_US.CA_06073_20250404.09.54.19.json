The next day, they conducted simulated trials where the Baja attorneys prepared opening statements, conducted direct and cross examination of witnesses, and delivered closing arguments. Rodriguez and the two other attorneys provided constructive feedback.\n\u201cThey are certainly making positive strides and improving their skills every day,\u201d said Rodriguez. \u201cThey are all very prepared, professional and eager to provide a zealous defense on behalf of their clients. \u00a0We are grateful for their collaboration.\u201d\nIn return for helping train their attorneys, Rodriguez said the Baja Public Defender helps the County office locate necessary information and documents in Mexico to defend San Diego clients. This partnership is essential because there is a constant need in San Diego to find important case-related information in Mexico, he said..\nSeveral years ago, Mexico transitioned to an adversarial system which uses a panel of judges instead of juries to determine a verdict in a public forum. Previously, lawyers submitted only written evidence and testimony to judges in a private forum.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20250404.09.54.19"}
