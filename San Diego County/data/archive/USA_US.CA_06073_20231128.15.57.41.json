Sheriff Kelly Martinez, Assistant Sheriff Theresa Adams-Hydar and Sheriff\u2019s Reentry Services Manager Patricia Ceballos accepted the award.\n\u201cThis award represents the Sheriff\u2019s Reentry Services Division\u2019s dedication to helping individuals achieve positive change and highlights the meaningful partnerships we have built to reinforce the positive impact we make each day,\u201d Ceballos said.\nWith more than three dozen reentry programs ranging from gardening and construction trades to culinary arts, Sheriff\u2019s Reentry Services gives incarcerated men and women the opportunity to learn valuable skills.\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Department partners with more than 40 organizations to connect incarcerated people with various resources for a successful transition back into society.\nSheriff\u2019s Reentry Services also collaborates with its partners to provide wellness classes. One partner is the Old Globe Theater which brings its performances right to the participants in custody through their Arts Engagement tours. The Old Globe Theater also offers a program that those reentering can attend upon their release from custody. This has helped many of them stay connected to one another and to the theater.\nAnother successful collaboration is with the San Diego Workforce Partnership. The organization has career centers at both the East Mesa Reentry Facility in Otay Mesa and the Las Colinas Detention and Reentry Facility in Santee.\nThe team from San Diego Workforce Partnership conducts workshops to support program participants with resumes, job interview skill building and connections to employers both during and post-incarceration. Employers are brought into county jails for a job fair, offering participants the opportunity to find a job before their release from custody.\nCommunity partnerships are key to providing additional education, skills, connection to services in the community while assisting in creating a pathway to sustainable employment and increased self-sufficiency.\nThese programs empower individuals by providing them with the tools and resources they need to succeed. Ultimately, these individuals achieve a greater level of independence, confidence and long-term success.\nParticipants are also provided services ranging from obtaining identification cards, birth certificates and enrolling in medical insurance prior to their release. Reentry programs are proven to help reduce rates of return to custody, increasing public safety and supporting successful reentry to the community.\nLearn more about Sheriff\u2019s Reentry Services.\n\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20231128.15.57.41"}
