Masking, home testing and vaccinations can help ensure you and your families don\u2019t spend this holiday season sick or worse.\u201d\nThe bivalent COVID-19 booster and flu vaccinations are separate shots that are both effective at decreasing the chance of catching the targeted viruses, being hospitalized, or dying.

Wearing a mask if able, particularly during indoor public gatherings, will help protect you and those around you.\nIn addition to vaccination and masking, there are a number of other precautions San Diegans can take to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu.
