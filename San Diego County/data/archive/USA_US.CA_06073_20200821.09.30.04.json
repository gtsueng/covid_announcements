You care; you want to protect the environment. But here\u2019s a question \u2014 are you recycling right?\nYou might not be. If you\u2019re putting the wrong items into your curbside blue bin \u2014 or even the right item in the wrong way \u2014 \u00a0you could be trashing your good intentions. And other people\u2019s too.\nTo help, San Diego County\u2019s Solid Waste Planning and Recycling division has launched a \u201cRecycle Right\u201d newspaper-radio-social media campaign.\nIt features two easy-to-use messages. First, go Back to the Basics \u2014 know what \u00a0can be recycled in that blue recycling bin your waste hauler picks up at your curb.\nSecond, remember this simple phrase: \u201cEmpty, Dry, Loose.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what can be recycled in that blue bin: paper, cardboard and cartons (boxes should be broken down), glass bottles and jars, plastic bottles and containers, and metal/aluminum containers and foil.\nWhat can\u2019t be recycled in your blue bin? Food, liquids, plastic bags, ropes, clothing, batteries and other items. Some of those things may be recycled in other ways, like returning plastic bags to stores, using compost bins and electronic waste recyclers.\nPutting plastic bags, clothing and cords into your blue bin can actually create a hazard to workers or machinery at recycling centers. Putting food and liquids in can contaminate the things you\u2019re trying to recycle, and anyone else\u2019s items they\u2019re mixed with. That would ruin your good intentions, and others, by forcing the contaminated items to be tossed into the trash where they end up needlessly filling landfills.\nHere\u2019s where the County \u201cRecycle Right\u201d campaign\u2019s second message, \u201cEmpty, Dry, Loose,\u201d comes in handy.\nFor example, let\u2019s say you have a completely empty, dry, glass peanut butter jar. Put that in that blue bin! But if that jar is only \u201calmost\u201d empty, please, keep it out. It could contaminate all your items. Better yet, clean it out first (a spatula works great!) and put it in.\nSo, make sure cans, jars, milk cartons and other recyclable containers are empty and dry.\nAnd put those items into your blue bin loose, NOT in plastic bags that can foul up recycling machinery. While trash collectors want your trash contained in bags \u2014 that doesn\u2019t work for recyclables.\nThat\u2019s it! Recycling is still simple with the right tips.\nFor more information about recycling, go to the Solid Waste Planning and Recycling division\u2019s Rethink Waste webpage.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20200821.09.30.04"}
