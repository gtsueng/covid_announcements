San Diegans should also make sure vulnerable populations, especially children, older adults and pets, are protected.\n\u201cOlder adults, infants and children, and people with chronic medical conditions are more prone to heat stress,\u201d said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cPeople with elderly neighbors should check on the well-being of the older persons.\u201d\nWhile the cool zones are not technically open, libraries, community centers and other buildings are open, and people can go cool there. Click\u00a0here to see hours and locations for County libraries. The Borrego Library\u2019s community room will be open from 12 to 5 p.m. Sat., April 9. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, masks are strongly recommended indoors.\nPet owners should exercise their pets in early morning hours or late afternoon and early evening to avoid prolonged exposure to the heat.\nEven a few hours spent in air conditioning can help your body stay cooler.

If someone shows these signs, call 9-1-1 and begin cooling the individual by:\n\nMoving them to a shaded area\nSpraying with cool water and fanning them\nPlacing them in a cool shower if they are alert\nMonitoring the body temperature, and continuing cooling efforts\nDo not give the victim fluids to drink\n\nMore information about the signs and symptoms of emergencies like heat exhaustion and heatstroke, visit the County Health and Human Services Agency Extreme Heat webpage.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20220406.17.42.46"}
