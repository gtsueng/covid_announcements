The dates of potential exposure are from February 17, 2024 to September 16, 2024. It can be difficult to diagnose tuberculosis and people with TB may be sick for many months before they are diagnosed. As such, periods of exposure can be long.\nBecause current evidence suggests the exposure is to drug-resistant tuberculosis, visitors to The Cove at La Jolla who believe they may have been exposed, or healthcare providers caring for those with known exposures, should call the County Tuberculosis Control Program at (619) 692-8621 for further guidance. Some of the medications typically used to prevent TB disease following an exposure may not be effective in this case.\nTB is an airborne disease that is transmitted from person-to-person through inhalation of the bacteria from the air. The bacteria are spread when someone sick with TB coughs, speaks, sings\u00a0or breathes. People with frequent and prolonged indoor exposure to a person who is sick with TB should get tested.\nEffective treatments are available to cure people who are sick from active TB. It is especially important for people with symptoms of active TB and those who are immune compromised to see a medical provider to rule out active TB disease and to discuss treatment.\n\u201cSymptoms of active TB include persistent cough, fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss,\u201d said Ankita Kadakia, M.D., County Interim Public Health Officer. \u201cMost people who become infected after exposure to tuberculosis do not get sick right away. This is called latent TB infection. Some who become infected with tuberculosis will become ill in the future, sometimes even years later, if their latent TB infection is not treated. For people who think they may have been exposed, blood tests and skin tests are an effective way to determine an infection.\u201d\nPeople who test positive for TB but who don\u2019t have symptoms of an active disease should get a chest x-ray and talk to a medical provider, as they most likely have a latent TB infection. People in this situation are infected with TB, but the infection is essentially dormant or \u201csleeping.\u201d Taking medicines for latent TB infection can cure the infection and keep these people from getting sick later.\nThe number of people diagnosed with active TB in San Diego County had decreased since the early 1990s when more than 400 cases were reported annually. After decades of declining, TB cases have begun to rise since 2020.\nIn 2020, there were 193 TB cases, 201 in 2021 and 208 in 2022.\u202fIn 2023, a total of 243 people were reported with active TB disease in San Diego County.\u202fThe 17 percent increase in 2023 brought the County back to\u00a0pre-pandemic levels.\nAn estimated 175,000 people in San Diego County have latent TB infection. Of these, 5 to 10 percent are at risk for developing active TB disease\u202fif they go\u202fwithout preventive treatment.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240926.16.44.48"}
