The County\u2019s Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement (OLSE) is getting the word out about the program.\nOLSE is also offering a new hiring tool kit to give employers guidelines on the new ordinance.\nPenalties for violations of the ordinance will begin on July 1, 2025. Employers could be fined up to $20,000 for multiple violations.\nFor more information about the new ordinance and the hiring tool kit, visit the County\u2019s Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement webpage or call 619-531-5129.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241112.15.54.03"}
