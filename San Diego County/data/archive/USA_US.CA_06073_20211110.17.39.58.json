In 2011, she became the Chief Deputy of the Election Services Division and within two years, she was promoted to Assistant Registrar of Voters. She became the interim registrar when the former registrar, Michael Vu, became the County\u2019s assistant chief administrative officer.\nPaes has a Master of Public Administration degree from California State University, Stanislaus and is a Certified Elections/Registration Administrator with the National Association of Elections Officials.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20211110.17.39.58"}
