A total of 1,702 cases were reported in the region last week, compared to 1,884 the previous week.\n\u201cOf the 11 influenza deaths reported last week, only two occurred last week,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H.,\u00a0County public health officer. \u201cThe fact that flu cases continued to decline could be a sign that influenza has peaked in San Diego. However, influenza cases are reported year round and we could see case increases in the weeks to come.\u201d\nThe County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.\nFor the week ending Feb. 1, 2020, the report shows the following:\n\nEmergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 8% of all visits (compared to 8% the previous week)\nTotal influenza deaths to date: 50 (compared to 24 at this time last season)\nTotal lab-confirmed cases to date: 13,569 (compared to 3,938 last season)\n\nWhen to Seek Medical Help\nPeople with influenza-like symptoms continue to crowd local emergency departments and are taxing some hospitals.\nCounty health officials are encouraging people who are sick to first contact their health care provider by telephone or arrange an urgent appointment. \u00a0You should go to an emergency department when you have any of the following symptoms:\n\nDifficulty breathing or shortness of breath\nChest pain or abdominal pain\nSudden dizziness\nConfusion\nSevere or persistent vomiting\nFlu-like symptoms that appear to get better, but then return with a fever and worse cough\n\nHow to Prevent the Flu\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year.
