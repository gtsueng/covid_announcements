and an individual with mobility limitations may need extra time, assistance, and specialized transportation to evacuate during a fire or flood,\u201d Gallo said. \u201cTo improve safety and well-being during a disaster, it is crucial to have a plan in place and establish a support network to provide appropriate assistance.\u201d\nGallo said caregivers can play an essential role in assisting the person in their care with emergency preparedness.\u202f They can act on the key steps outlined in the Personal Disaster Plan\u202fsuch as helping to identify emergency contacts, testing\u00a0smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, securing\u00a0a back-up power source for\u00a0life-sustaining medical equipment,\u00a0and/or completing\u00a0a Vial of Life document to provide emergency responders with life-saving medical information.\nVisit\u00a0ReadySanDiego.org\u00a0to learn more about making a personal disaster plan and additional services available.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210901.10.29.54"}
