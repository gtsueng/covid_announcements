The Diasorin Liaison XL will be ready for use when the new county Public Health Lab opens in late spring 2025.\u00a0\nUnlike traditional skin testing for TB, the Diasorin can test a person\u2019s blood to aid the diagnosis of latent TB infection.\n\u201cThe biggest challenge in preventing TB is that many people are unaware they have it,\u201d said Dr. Ankita Kadakia, MD, County interim public health officer. \u201cLatent or dormant TB can be easily treated, yet an estimated 85% of active TB cases come from untreated latent TB. \u00a0Latent TB sleeps in someone\u2019s body until they develop conditions such as immune suppression which causes the TB to wake up and cause disease. We estimate 175,000 people in San Diego County have latent TB infections,\u201d \u00a0\nThe machine\u2019s speed is expected to increase the number of tests for TB. It will find greater numbers of unknown infections which will allow more people to get treatment.\u00a0\n More information is available on the County\u2019s Public Health Lab webpage and the County\u2019s Tuberculosis webpage.\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20241210.15.32.16"}
