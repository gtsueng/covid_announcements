This group includes about 180 employees at the County Psychiatric Hospital.\n\u201cWe first have to vaccinate our acute health care personnel who are at highest risk,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cAfter everyone in that group has gotten their first dose, we will move into our next priority group.\u201d\nAfter this first group is vaccinated, additional doses coming into the region will also be used to immunize more personnel in acute health care settings, including 14,000 employees at high risk of getting COVID-19, followed by 14,000 employees at medium risk and another 14,000 employees who are lower risk.\nEach health care system is responsible for how it prioritizes and administers the vaccines to its employees in the Phase 1A \u2013 Tier 1 guidelines. All 28,000 recipients in the initial group will get their second dose when more Pfizer vaccine arrives in the region.\nAn employee at the County Psychiatric Hospital gets her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine.\nThe County is still in the process of determining how many people fall into the Phase 1A-Tier 1 priority group, as well as the number of San Diegans who are part of Tier 2 and Tier 3.\nResidents and employees of skilled nursing facilities are also part of the first priority group. The majority will be vaccinated under federal contracts by staff from local CVS and Walgreens pharmacies.\nAs other pharmaceutical companies receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, more vaccines will arrive in the region.\nWhen the vaccine is available to the general public, which is expected to happen in spring 2021, people will be able to get the vaccine from their health care provider, local pharmacies, community clinics or County vaccination sites. In some cases, employers may provide them to employees.\nFor more information about the COVID-19 vaccine, vaccination phases and priority groups, visit coronavirus-sd.com.\nICU Capacity and Stay Home Order:\n\nThe current ICU capacity for the Southern California region is now 0.5% and will be updated by the state daily.\nThe Regional Stay Home Order is now in effect and prohibits gatherings of any size with people from other households and adds restrictions for multiple sectors.\nThe order will last for at least three weeks or until the region\u2019s ICU capacity meets or exceeds 15%.
