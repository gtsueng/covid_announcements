Early symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. The distinctive red rash usually appears one to four days after early symptoms appear. A person is considered contagious four days before and four days after the rash appears. The rash typically begins on the face and head, then proceeds downward and outward to the hands and feet. It fades in the same order it began, from head to feet.\n\u201cThe best way to prevent measles is by getting the measles vaccine,\u201d said Kadakia. \u201cWith measles outbreaks occurring in several countries, it is very important that all international travelers get vaccinated. Infants between 6 and 12 months of age who travel should get one dose, and travelers over 12 months of age should get two doses at least four weeks apart.\u201d\nComplications from measles are more common in children younger include diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia. Death can occur from severe complications and the risk is higher among younger children and adults.\nThere is no treatment for measles. Bed rest, fluids, and fever control are recommended. People with complications may need treatment for their specific problems.\nFor more information about measles, other vaccine-preventable diseases and the shots that protect against them, please call the HHSA Immunization Branch at (866) 358-2966 or visit the website at\u00a0www.sdiz.org.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240331.14.07.57"}
