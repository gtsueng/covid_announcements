In the past nine months, its members reached out to over 110,000 people through social media, websites, email and other methods.\u00a0\nThe County\u2019s annual blood drive is among the largest collection events organized by the San Diego Blood Bank. Both County and non-County employees are welcome to sign up and donate.\u00a0\nBlood Drives at County of San Diego Locations by Region\u00a0\nBelow is a list of locations, organized by region to book an appointment:\u00a0\nCentral\u00a0\nHCDS \u2013 HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SERVICES | BOOK NOW \nWED, APR 9 | 9 a.m. \u2013 2:30 p.m. | Parked Curbside, 3989 Ruffin Rd., San Diego, CA 92123\u00a0\nCOUNTY OPERATIONS CENTER\u00a0\nTHURS, APR 10 |\u00a09 a.m. \u2013 2:30 p.m. | BOOK NOW\nTUES, APR 29 | 9 a.m. \u2013 2:30 p.m. | BOOK NOW\nMain Entrance Cul de Sac, 5560 Overland Ave., San Diego, CA 92123\nDEPARTMENT OF CHILD AND FAMILY WELL-BEING | BOOK NOW\nTUE, APR 15 | 8:30 a.m. \u2013 2 p.m. | Parking Lot, 8911 Balboa Ave., San Diego, CA 9212\u00a0\nSHERIFF HEADQUARTERS | BOOK NOW\nWED, APR 16 | 9 a.m. \u2013 2:30 p.m. | Parking Lot, 9621 Ridgehaven, San Diego, CA 92123\u00a0\nSEVILLE PLAZA | BOOK NOW\nTHUR, APR 17 | 9 a.m. \u2013 2:30 p.m. | Visitor Parking Lot, 5469 Kearny Villa Rd., San Diego, CA 92123\u00a0\nYOUTH DEVELOPMENT CENTER | BOOK NOW\nTUES, APR 22 | 9:30 a.m. \u2013 3:00 p.m. | Parking Lot, 2901 Meadow Lark Dr., San Diego, CA 92123\u00a0\nNORTH CENTRAL FRC | BOOK NOW\nTUES, APR 22 | 10:30 a.m. \u2013 4 p.m. | Parking Lot, 5055 Ruffin Rd., San Diego, CA 92123\u00a0\nDowntown\u00a0\nSAN DIEGO SUPERIOR COURT | BOOK NOW\nWED, APR 2 | 10:30 a.m. \u2013 4 p.m. | Parked in front of Hall of Justice, 330 W.
