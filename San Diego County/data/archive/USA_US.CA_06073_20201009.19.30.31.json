If you attend a gathering and develop COVID-19 symptoms within 48 hours of a gathering, you should notify everyone who was there.\nThose in a high-risk group, such as older adults and people with chronic medical conditions, are strongly urged not to attend gatherings.\nSee complete guidance\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20201009.19.30.31"}
