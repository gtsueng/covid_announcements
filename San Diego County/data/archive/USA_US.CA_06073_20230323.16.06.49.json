But said these workers have an ally at the County.\nShe pointed to the new Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement and a proposed wage theft fund.\nShe said it\u2019s about fairness and she had a message for every honest San Diego business.\n\u201cThese rules help you because unscrupulous employers who cheat their employees have an unfair advantage and honest companies can\u2019t compete. So together we can change that,\u201d said Vice Chair Terra Lawson Remer.\nThe DA\u2019s office opened a Workplace Justice Division in 2021 and learned from the community that when it comes to wage theft, people don\u2019t really know it\u2019s a crime.\n\u201cWhen your wages are stolen, if they\u2019re under $950 that is still a crime, a misdemeanor crime,\u201d said District Attorney Summer Stephan. \u201cBut if it\u2019s over $950, that\u2019s a felony crime that your DA\u2019s office is going to bring and there\u2019s real accountability.\u201d\nThe state is also making changes to make sure workers know their rights especially those in underserved communities. It launched an outreach campaign called \u201cReaching Every Californian.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to get out of our offices and go out into the community and meet workers where they are. All workers, not just workers who know their rights\u2026\u201d said Lilia Garc\u00eda-Brower, Labor Commissioner of the California Department of Industrial Relations. \u201c\u2026It is our obligation to get to them because if workers don\u2019t understand their rights, how are they going to exercise them? So outreach is foundational to enforcement.\u201d\nThe Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement reaches out to educate workers and businesses countywide on their rights and responsibilities, too.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also created the Fair Place Collaborative bringing together both businesses and worker advocacy organizations and stakeholders to help chart the course for our office,\u201d said Brandon Butler, Deputy Director, County\u2019s Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement. \u201cWe developed new policies with our County Department of Purchasing and Contracting to implement anti wage theft rules within our key contracting procedures. And we also ensured that County contract vendors comply with workers\u2019 rights laws here in the county.\u201d\nDuring Thursday\u2019s event, a proclamation was presented to a close County partner, the director of the Employee Rights Center, Alor Calderon. The news conference also kicked off a Week of Action designed to educate people about workers\u2019 rights.\nFor additional information on workers\u2019 rights and how to file a claim, you can reach the County Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement through its advice line at\u00a0619-985-1597\u00a0or at OLSE@sdcounty.ca.gov.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20230323.16.06.49"}
