The initiative\u2019s goals are to:\n\nAddress the causes of persistent inequality and identify best practices\nPromote the use of specific interventions designed to fill gaps in current programming\nProvide funding to County health departments to promote leadership and coordination for widespread and lasting change in public awareness\n\nBlack mothers in California are more than three times more likely to die due to pregnancy and delivery complications than white mothers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These health outcome disparities persist regardless of factors, such as the mother\u2019s income or education.\n\u201cThese disparities are unjust, inexcusable and cannot be allowed to persist,\u201d said Chair Nathan Fletcher, County Board of Supervisors. \u201cRacism is a significant threat to the health and vitality of our community and none of us can stand idly by while babies and mothers continue to die.\u201d\nBlack Legacy Now aligns with Live Well San Diego, the County\u2019s vision of healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities. The campaign is bringing together San Diego County\u2019s top health care, government, public policy and maternal and infant health experts to address these disparities and create concrete plans for reducing systemic bias and improving health outcomes for Black families in San Diego County.\n\u201cWhile it is often said, \u2018it takes a village to raise a child\u2019, it will take each and every one of us to stand up to long-standing inequities,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThe first step is education, followed by community-wide action. This launch is the first step in what will be a long-term campaign focused on driving real, measurable change for Black families in San Diego County.\u201d\nDr. Kelly Elmore, Perinatal Equity Initiative Community Advisory Board member and board-certified OB/GYN, outlined potential changes for local health care systems including:\n\nStandardization of maternal and infant care protocols for physicians and patient education\nAn increase in remote patient monitoring for new parent support\nIncorporating mental health counseling into routine post-partum care\nUpdates to patient discharge instructions to provide new mothers with simple instructions and tips for knowing when to seek medical help\nIncreased access to alternative birthing centers and midwifery\n\n\nHHSA already funds the San Diego County Black Infant Health Program, which offers social support, stress management and empowerment through prenatal/postpartum groups and one-on-one sessions\u2014 to help women to understand their risks and try to reduce them. Additionally, PEI supports a Fatherhood Initiative for soon-to-be fathers and fathers with an infant up to 1 year of age and whose partner is Black, as well as implicit bias training for medical providers to improve services for Black pregnant and parenting women.\nVisit www.blacklegacynowsd.com to get the facts, Know Your Rights, and commit to action by advocating for Black women, babies and families in San Diego.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210128.16.35.47"}
