Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. \u201cThe best way to lower your risk of getting influenza is to get vaccinated.\u201d\nThe County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the\u00a0Influenza Watch\u00a0weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.\nFor the week ending Oct. 30, 2021, the report shows the following:\n\nEmergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared to 3% the previous week)\nTotal influenza deaths to date: 0 (there were no deaths at this time last season)\nTotal people who have been vaccinated to date: 690,617 (compared to 770,054 at the same time last season)\n\nPreventing the Flu\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year.
