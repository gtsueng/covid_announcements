This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.\nOverall, more than 1.3 million County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That\u2019s 48.4% of those eligible\nOf those vaccinated to date, nearly 833,000 County residents, or 31% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.\nThe goal is to fully vaccinate\u00a075% of San Diego County residents 16 and older or 2,017,011 people. To date, 64.5% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 41.3% are fully vaccinated.\nThose who received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine,\u00a0which is currently on hold\u00a0in the County due to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration, are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.\nThe difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.\nMore information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County\u2019s\u00a0vaccination dashboard. For vaccination opportunities, visit\u00a0www.vaccinationsuperstation.com.\n\nState Metrics:\n\nSan Diego County\u2019s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 6.1 cases per 100,000 residents (as of April 20).\nThe County remains in the Orange Tier or Tier 3 under the state\u2019s new guidance. The California Department of Public Health indicates that unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as low rate of vaccine uptake, a county will only move to a more restrictive tier if hospitalizations are increasing significantly among vulnerable individuals, especially among vaccinated individuals, and both testing positivity and adjusted case rates show a concerning increase in transmission. This is currently not the case in the region.\nCurrently, the testing positivity percentage is 2.4%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier.\nThe County\u2019s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 3.0% and is also in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.\nCDPH assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, April 27.\n\nCommunity Setting Outbreaks:\n\nNo new community outbreaks were confirmed April 19.\nIn the past seven days (April 13 through April 19), 21 community outbreaks were confirmed.\nThe number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.\nA community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.\n\nTesting:\n\n7,747 tests were reported to the County on April 19, and the percentage of new positive cases was 3%.\nThe 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 1.8%. Target is less than 8.0%.\nThe 7-day, daily average of tests is 12,779.\n\nCases, Hospitalizations and ICU Admissions:\n\n256 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County on April 19. The region\u2019s total is now 275,368.\n15,171 or 5.5% of all cases have required hospitalization.\n1,676 or 0.6% of all cases and 11% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.\n\nDeaths:\n\nNo new COVID-19 deaths were reported April 19. The region\u2019s total is 3,674.\n\nMore Information:\nThe more detailed data summaries found on the\u00a0County\u2019s coronavirus-sd.com website\u00a0are updated around 5 p.m. daily.\n\u00a0\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20210420.17.25.48"}
