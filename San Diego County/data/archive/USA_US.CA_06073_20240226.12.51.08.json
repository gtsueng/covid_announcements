If someone can perform this before medical professionals arrive, it vastly increases a person\u2019s likelihood of survival.\nIn recent years, CPR training has shifted to the hand-only approach. Mouth-to-mouth breathing is no longer considered essential.\nIn 2021, 8 percent of people who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in San Diego County were successfully revived and survived.\n\u201cCardiac arrest continues to be a leading cause of death across the country,\u201d said Kristi Koenig, M.D., County of San Diego Emergency Medical Services medical director and co-lead of the Revive & Survive San Diego initiative. \u201cNo amount of preparedness in a hospital can save a life if the person does not make into the building. Receiving CPR at the scene will save lives.\u201d\nBrain death starts to occur four to six minutes after someone experiences cardiac arrest if there is no CPR and defibrillation during that time. For every minute CPR is delayed, survival from cardiac arrest decreases by 7 to 10 percent.\nOn Monday, leaders from the County, UC San Diego, healthcare and the community participated in a news conference to share more details about the initiative.\u00a0 Emergency doctors from across the region provided hands-on CPR demonstrations and training as part of the event.\nRevive & Survive San Diego will work with local healthcare providers and community partner organizations to offer free hands-only CPR training and perform community outreach countywide.\n\u201cThere is a critical need for community CPR education to help bystanders recognize and intervene when someone suffers from cardiac arrest,\u201d said Cheryl A.M. Anderson, Ph.D., M.P.H., dean, UC San Diego Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science and co-lead of Revive & Survive San Diego.\nFor more information about Revive & Survive San Diego, including opportunities for CPR training, becoming a partner or to support the initiative, visit revivesurvive.ucsd.edu.\n ", "location": {"name": "San Diego County", "_id": "USA_US-CA_06073"}, "_id": "USA_US.CA_06073_20240226.12.51.08"}
